    "abstract": "Optical techniques for spatiotemporal control can produce laser pulses with custom amplitude, phase, or polarization structure. In nonlinear optics and plasma physics, the use of structured pulses typically follows a forward design approach, in which the efficacy of a known structure is analyzed for a particular application. Inverse approaches, in contrast, enable the discovery of new structures with the potential for superior performance. Here, an implementation of the unidirectional pulse propagation equation that supports automatic differentiation is combined with gradient-based optimization to design structured pulses with features that are advantageous for a range of nonlinear optical and plasma-based applications: (1) a longitudinally uniform intensity over an extended region, (2) a superluminal intensity peak that travels many Rayleigh ranges with constant duration, spot size, and amplitude, and (3) a laser pulse that ionizes a gas to form a uniform column of plasma. In the final case, optimizing the full spatiotemporal structure improves the performance by a factor of 15 compared to optimizing only spatial or only temporal structure, highlighting the advantage of spatiotemporal control.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this Letter, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\\beta$ solar wind using Cluster spacecraft measurements. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfv\\'en and compressible modes, we reveal that the anisotropy is strongly mode dependent: quasi-parallel (`slab') energy contains both Alfv\\'en and compressible modes, whereas quasi-perpendicular (`two-dimensional'; 2D) energy is almost purely Alfv\\'enic, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. These findings elucidate the physical origin of the long-standing `slab+2D' empirical model and offer a new perspective on the turbulence cascade across the full three-dimensional wavevector space.",

    "abstract": "Non-axisymmetric, flow-driven instabilities in the incompressible Hall-MHD model are studied in a differentially rotating cylindrical plasma. It is found that in the Hall-MHD regime, both whistler waves and ion-cyclotron waves can extract energy from the flow shear, resulting in two distinct branches of global instability. The non-axisymmetric whistler modes grow significantly faster than non-axisymmetric, ideal MHD modes. A discussion of the whistler instability mechanism is presented in the large-ion-skin-depth, `electron-MHD' limit. It is observed that the effect of the Hall term on the non-axisymmetric modes can be appreciable when $d_i$ is on the order of a few % of the width of the cylindrical annulus. Distinct global modes emerge in the Hall-MHD regime at significantly stronger magnetic fields than those required for unstable global MHD modes.",

While DLA in high-density plasma optimizes the energy transfer from a laser pulse to electrons, it exacerbates nonlinear propagation effects, such as filamentation, that can disrupt the acceleration process. Here, we show that superluminal flying-focus pulses (FFPs) mitigate nonlinear propagation, thereby enhancing the number of high-energy electrons and resulting x-ray yield. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that, compared to a Gaussian pulse of equal energy (1 J) and intensity (2x10^20 W/cm^2), an FFP produces 80x more electrons above 100 MeV, increases the electron cutoff energy by 20%, triples the high-energy x-ray yield, and improves x-ray collimation. These results illustrate the ability of spatiotemporally structured laser pulses to provide additional control in the highly nonlinear, relativistic regime of laser-plasma interactions.",

    "abstract": "We extend our previous work on a semi-Lagrangian adaptive rank (SLAR) integrator, in the finite difference framework for nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems, to the general high-order tensor setting. The proposed scheme retains the high-order accuracy of semi-Lagrangian methods, ensuring stability for large time steps and avoiding dimensional splitting errors. The primary contribution of this paper is the novel extension of the algorithm from the matrix to the high-dimensional tensor setting, which enables the simulation of Vlasov models in up to six dimensions. The key technical components include (1) a third-order high-dimensional polynomial reconstruction that scales as $O(d^2)$, providing a point-wise approximation of the solution at the foot of characteristics in a semi-Lagrangian scheme; (2) a recursive hierarchical adaptive cross approximation of high-order tensors in a hierarchical Tucker format, characterized by a tensor tree; (3) a low-complexity Poisson solver in the hierarchical Tucker format that leverages the FFT for efficiency. The computed adaptive rank kinetic solutions exhibit low-rank structures within branches of the tensor tree resulting in substantial computational savings in both storage and time. The resulting algorithm achieves a computational complexity of $O(d^4 N r^{3+\\lceil\\log_2d\\rceil})$, where $N$ is the number of grid points per dimension, $d$ is the problem dimension, and $r$ is the maximum rank in the tensor tree, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Through extensive numerical tests, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and highlight its ability to capture complex solution structures while maintaining a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N$.",

These dense driver beams can drive wakes even in high-density plasmas ($\\gtrsim10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$), where betatron radiation becomes increasingly important and begins to affect the dynamics of the accelerated beam. In this Letter, we show that betatron cooling leads to a strong, structuring of the phase space of the beam. This gives rise to bunched, ring-like structures with positive radial position and momentum gradients, \\emph{i.e.}, population inversion of the amplitude of oscillation. We derive the characteristic timescales for this process analytically and confirm our predictions with multi-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations. The radiation-dominated regime of beam dynamics fundamentally alters the acceleration process and produces self-structured beams capable of triggering coherent betatron emission in ion channels.",

    "abstract": "The Multifaceted Asymmetric Radiation From the Edge (MARFE) is a critical plasma instability that often precedes density-limit disruptions in tokamaks, posing a significant risk to machine integrity and operational efficiency. Early and reliable alert of MARFE formation is therefore essential for developing effective disruption mitigation strategies, particularly for next-generation devices like ITER. This paper presents a novel, physics-informed indicator for early MARFE prediction and disruption warning developed for the HL-3 tokamak. Our framework integrates two core innovations: (1) a high-fidelity label refinement pipeline that employs a physics-scored, weighted Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to systematically correct noise and artifacts in raw visual data from cameras, and (2) a continuous-time, physics-constrained Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) model that predicts the short-horizon ``worsening\" of a MARFE. By conditioning the model's dynamics on key plasma parameters such as normalized density ($f_G$, derived from core electron density) and core electron temperature ($T_e$), the predictor achieves superior performance in the low-false-alarm regime crucial for control. On a large experimental dataset from HL-3, our model demonstrates high predictive accuracy, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.969 for 40ms-ahead prediction. The indicator has been successfully deployed for real-time operation with updates every 1 ms. This work lays a very foundation for future proactive MARFE mitigation.",

While astrophysical jets are usually magnetized, how MI acts in magnetized jets remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a flow-aligned external magnetic field on MI, with both theoretical analyses and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In the limit of a cold and collisionless plasma, we derive a generalized dispersion relation for linear growth rates of the magnetized MIs. Numerical solutions of the dispersion relation reveal that the external magnetic field always suppresses the growth of MI, though MIs are much more robust against the external magnetic field than electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (ESKHIs). Analyses are also extended to instabilities with an arbitrary wavevector in the shear interface plane, where coupling effect is observed for sub-relativistic scenarios. Two-dimensional PIC simulations of single-mode MIs reach a good agreement with our analytical predictions, and we observe formation of a quasi-steady saturation structure in magnetized runs. In simulations with finite temperatures, we observe the competition and cooperation between MIs and a diffusion-induced DC magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "We report a fully kinetic, quantum study of Kinetic Electrostatic Electron Nonlinear (KEEN) waves, showing that quantum diffraction systematically erodes the classical trapping mechanism, narrow harmonic locking to the fundamental, and hasten post-drive decay. Electrons are evolved with a second-order Strang-split 1D1V Wigner-Poisson solver that couples conservative semi-Lagrangian WENO advection to an analytic Fourier space update for the non-local Wigner term, while ions remain classical. Short, frequency-tuned ponderomotive pulses drive KEEN formation in a uniform Maxwellian plasma; as the dimensionless quantum parameter H rises from the classical limit to values relevant to warm-dense matter, doped semiconductors, and 2D electron systems, the drive threshold increases, higher harmonics are damped, trapped electron vortices diffuse, and the subplasma electrostatic energy relaxes to a lower stationary level, as confirmed by continuous wavelet analysis. These microscopic changes carry macroscopic weight. Ignition-scale capsules now compress matter to regimes where the electron de Broglie wavelength rivals the Debye length, making classical kinetic descriptions insufficient. By extending KEEN physics into this quantum domain, our results offer a potential diagnostic of nonequilibrium electron dynamics for next-generation inertial-confinement designs and high-energy-density platforms, indicating that predictive fusion modeling may benefit from the integration of kinetic fidelity with quantum effects.",

The BTOF has a series of wavelength resonant reflection fiber Bragg gratings written uniformly along its length. The fiber's Verdet constant determines the strength of the Faraday effect which effectuates the measurement of local B along the fiber placed intimately next to or within a magnetized plasma volume. A robust measurement of the field distribution along the fiber is obtained at high rep rates, 5 MHz, high spatial resolution(1-10cm), high B field accuracy(<1%) and temporal response (ns). Multipathing in the BTOF produces 3rd order reflections that contaminate the LIDAR signal. Algorithms are given for calculating the level of contamination for uniform and flat reflection designs, in particular and any reflection series in general. The contamination is bracketed giving confidence in designing and implementing a BTOF.

    "abstract": "The quality of high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) deposited films can often improve through the effective use of metal-ion acceleration, requiring precise measurements of time-of-flight (ToF). These measurements are commonly done using time- and energy-resolved mass spectrometry but require careful consideration of the transit time of ions inside. The transit time is typically calculated by considering the travel length in various parts of the spectrometer (e.g. from orifice to detector), but errors associated with these estimations can lead to nonphysical values in a HiPIMS process (e.g. negative ToFs). Here we report a practical approach to determine ion ToF experimentally, using a bipolar HiPIMS power supply to synchronize a gating pulse to the front-end of a HIDEN Analytical EQP-300 mass spectrometer, placed at the working distance. The ToF is measured by applying a +70 V bias to repel ions, and a 5 us gating pulse of 0 V to accept them. To prevent interference with the HiPIMS plasma, a grounded shield is placed in front of the mass-spec head with a variable slit-opening (0.5-3 mm). The effectiveness of the shielding is verified by Langmuir probe measurements, noting negligible shifts in plasma potential for a DC sputter discharge. The gate is then synchronized to a HiPIMS pulse and data collected at 5 us intervals by adjusting the pulse delay. Measurements of the time-of-flights of Ar+, Al+, Sc+, Y+, and W+ ions are presented; Al+ and Ar+ ions were also compared to ToF calculated using mass spectrometry flight tube equations.",

The Landau collision operator is treated through a stochastic particle formulation inspired by the grazing-collision limit of the Boltzmann equation, which enables an efficient and physically consistent representation of Coulomb interactions without relying on the full Boltzmann structure. The resulting collisional solver is combined, via operator splitting, with standard PIC schemes for the Vlasov-Maxwell dynamics, providing flexibility in the choice of field discretisation and time integration. The overall method preserves the main physical invariants of the system while maintaining computational efficiency and simplicity of implementation. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the coupled DSMC-PIC approach across a wide range of collisional regimes.",

We validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and/or two-dimensional complex plasmas confined by a central potential.

    "abstract": "When a high-power, femtosecond, circularly polarized (CP) laser pulse is incident on a micrometer-scale aperture in a solid foil target, it drives surface plasma oscillation, generating high-order harmonic vortices in the diffracted light. However, this mechanism has so far only been studied theoretically under ideal conditions. In this work, we perform numerical studies on more realistic situations. In particular, we focus on a scenario where the laser is obliquely incident on the target surface to avoid the potential damage of the optics by the reflected light. We demonstrate that increasing oblique incidence angle, reducing target thickness, and improving laser contrast can enhance the harmonic conversion efficiency. However, the generated harmonic beams may contain both Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) (vortex) and non-LG components under non-ideal conditions. We show that they can be separated by their divergence, as the vortex components has smaller diverging angle. In addition, we have performed computational analyses on the harmonic divergence angles and topological charge spectra of vortex high-order harmonics under different conditions. These high-order harmonic pure LG modes can potentially be filtered out for wide range of fundamental and applied physics researches. This study provides valuable insights for the design and implementation of future experiments.",

    "abstract": "The Sun's magnetic field shows the 11-year solar cycle and shorter periodicities, popularly known as the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) and Rieger-type periods, or ``season of the Sun.\" Although several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of QBOs and Rieger-type periods, no single theory has widespread acceptance. We explore whether the \\bl\\ dynamo can produce Rieger-type periodicity and QBOs and investigate their underlying physical mechanisms. We use the observationally guided three-dimensional kinematic \\bl\\ dynamo model, which has emerged as a successful model for reproducing many characteristic features of the solar cycle. We use Morlet wavelet and global wavelet power spectrum techniques to analyze the data obtained from the model. In our model, we report QBOs and Rieger-type periods for the first time. Further, we investigate the individual \\bl\\ parameters (fluctuations in flux, latitude, time delay and tilt scatter) role in the occurrence of QBOs and Rieger-type periods. We find that while fluctuations in the individual parameters of the \\bl\\ process can produce QBOs and Rieger-type periodicity, their occurrence probability is enhanced when we consider combined fluctuations of all parameters in the \\bl\\ process. Finally, we find that with the increase of dynamo supercriticality, the model tends to suppress the generation of Rieger-type periodicity. Thus, this result supports earlier studies that suggest the solar dynamo is not highly supercritical.",

    "abstract": "Structures in tokamak plasmas are elongated along the direction of the magnetic field and short in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. Many tokamak simulation codes take advantage of this by using a field aligned coordinate system. However, field aligned coordinate systems have a coordinate singularity at magnetic X-points where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes, which makes it difficult to use field aligned coordinate systems when simulating the core and scrape-off layer (SOL) simultaneously. Here we present an algorithm for computing geometric quantities in a standard field aligned coordinate system that avoids the singularity and allows one to conduct 2D axisymmetric simulations in X-point geometries. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm with an example simulation of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP).",

    "abstract": "Cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are non-equilibrium plasmas, that are capable of producing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) at near-room temperature. Their interaction with water leads to the formation of plasma-activated water (PAW), whose chemical activity depends on discharge conditions. In this work, a helium-air (14:1) micro-plasma jet operated in a ring-to-ring electrode configuration is used to generate PAW and study its influence on the growth of Chrysanthemum saplings. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) confirms the presence of $N_2$ bands and He lines, with the He-air mixture providing more chemically active discharge (in terms of favoring the generation of nitrates in PAW) as compared to pure helium. The physicochemical characteristics of PAW such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and total dissolved solids (TDS) are analyzed as a function of plasma treatment time and water volume. The optimum condition for PAW generation is found to be 12 ml of de-ionized (DI) water treated for 40 minutes, which yields the highest ORP and nitrate concentration with a reduced pH. Comparative growth experiments over two weeks show that PAW-treated Chrysanthemum saplings exhibit significantly greater height (10.2 cm) and soil fertility (2580 $\\mu$S/cm) than those watered with same amount of DI water or tap water. The results highlight the potential of PAW for sustainable enhancement of growth of flowering plants.",

As in many areas of science, numerical simulations have become a vital tool for uncovering new physical phenomena and guiding technological development. Code benchmarking remains crucial for verifying implementations and evaluating performance. This work continues the Landmark benchmark initiative, a series specifically designed to support the verification of low-temperature plasma codes. In this study, seventeen simulation codes from a collaborative community of nineteen international institutions modeled a partially magnetized ExB Penning discharge. The emergence of large scale coherent structures, or rotating plasma spokes, endows this configuration with an enormous range of time scales, making it particularly challenging to simulate. The codes showed excellent agreement on the rotation frequency of the spoke as well as key plasma properties, including time-averaged ion density, plasma potential, and electron temperature profiles. Achieving this level of agreement came with challenges, and we share lessons learned on how to conduct future benchmarking campaigns. Comparing code implementations, computational hardware, and simulation runtimes also revealed interesting trends, which are summarized with the aim of guiding future plasma simulation software development.",

Here we present scaled laboratory experiments based on laser-driven plasma outflow into magnetized ambient gas, which mimic five basic astrophysical outflows regulated by interstellar medium, namely collimated jets, blocked jets, elliptical bubbles, as well as spherical winds and bubbles. Their morphologies and existence conditions are found to be uniquely determined by the external Alfvenic and sonic Mach numbers Me-a and Me-s, i.e. the relative strengths of the outflow ram pressure against the magnetic/thermal pressures in the interstellar medium, with transitions occurring at Me-a ~ 2 and 0.5, as well as Me-s ~ 1. These results are confirmed by magnetohydrodynamics simulations and should also be verifiable from existing and future astronomical observations.

    "abstract": "We present two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical at intermittent structures in plasma turbulence. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. The interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked by a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by KH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the interaction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are stochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear layer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process takes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI interaction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles produced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are present in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such as in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc., and highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.",

Especially, in plasmas, mixing can be enhanced through turbulence spreading by intermittent coherent structures (blobs/voids), or suppressed due to the formation of transport barriers (sheared zonal flows). Interestingly, blobs/voids and zonal flows are not independent, and they can co-exist in a state of inhomogeneous mixing, often called the E x B staircase. In this paper, we first introduce recent experimental progress on the physics of blobs/voids: how turbulence spreading by blobs/voids occurs, the consequences of enhanced turbulence spreading for the power decay length, and the interaction between blobs/voids and zonal flows. Then, we provide a brief review of experimental results on staircases, or more generally layered mesoscopic transport barriers. Staircases are often elusive and different complementary methods have been utilized to identify them, but our understanding is still incomplete. This paper serves as an initial step toward applying insights gained from inhomogeneous mixing due to blobs/voids to the understanding of a staircase.",

Our methods follow from our recent work calculating diffusion coefficients in perfect body-centered cubic crystals. These diffusion coefficients show only a weak dependence on the crystal orientations at the grain boundary and are consistent with those expected for a supercooled liquid scaled down by one to two orders of magnitude. We argue that the local disorder at the grain boundary produces a landscape of potential barriers similar to that of an amorphous liquid thin film, significantly reducing activation barriers to diffusive hops relative to the bulk solid. This also introduces a screening dependence, such that boundary diffusion does not exhibit the same universality as the bulk crystal. These diffusion coefficients suggest that grain boundaries may be a dominant source of viscous dissipation in neutron star crusts.",

Key findings reveal an averaged three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in $\\varepsilon_C$ when transitioning from the solar wind to the magnetosheath.

By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\\kappa$ tails for $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\\delta B_0/B_0 \\ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\\bf v}_E \\cdot {\\bf \\kappa}$, with ${\\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\\bf\\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions.

A localized induction-cell perturbation produced a negative density pulse that evolved into a leading soliton-like peak followed by an expanding train of oscillations. The leading peak satisfied soliton scaling laws for width^2 vs inverse amplitude and velocity vs amplitude, while the total wave-train width increased linearly with time, consistent with Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) predictions.

    "abstract": "We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{\\'e}n and oblique magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear Alfv{\\'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.",

    "abstract": "Recent nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations have shown that impurities can strongly modify the turbulent heat flux in stellarator plasmas. Here, the ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) dispersion relation in a plasma containing impurities is analytically solved in certain limits and an expression for the modification of the ITG growth rate by impurities is derived. The analytical expression is the sum of three terms corresponding to three different physical causes (impurity density gradient, impurity temperature gradient and dilution) of the change in the growth rate. The scalings predicted analytically for the modification of the growth rate are shown to be reproduced by linear gyrokinetic simulations. The conditions for reduction or increase of the ITG growth by impurities are also correctly predicted by the analytical solution to the dispersion relation. Finally, a remarkable correlation is found between the analytical expression for the modification of the growth rate and the modification of the turbulent heat flux obtained from nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations.",

This conclusion is supported by the close agreement between simulated and experimentally measured heat and particle fluxes. The emergence of MTMs is attributed to the absence of competing instabilities -- such as ion temperature gradient modes and density-gradient-driven trapped-electron modes -- under these plasma conditions, together with the stabilizing influence of the W7-X max-J magnetic configuration. Furthermore, moderate collisionality and low magnetic shear are found to facilitate MTM onset. These findings advance the understanding of high-density-gradient regimes, which are essential for achieving high-performance operation in W7-X plasmas.",

    "abstract": "The Tokamak \\`a Configuration Variable (TCV) is equipped with an advanced set of diagnostics for studying suprathermal electron dynamics. Among these, the vertical electron cyclotron emission (VECE) diagnostic offers valuable insights into the electron energy distribution by measuring electron cyclotron emission (ECE) along a vertical line-of-sight. However, reconstructing the electron distribution from ECE measurements is inherently challenging due to harmonic overlap and thermal radiation noise. A more practical approach leverages forward modeling of ECE based on kinetic simulations. To this end, we introduce YODA, a novel synthetic ECE diagnostic framework that simulates emission and (re)absorption of electron cyclotron radiation for arbitrary electron distributions and antenna geometries. The framework is validated against the well-established synthetic ECE code SPECE, using an ohmic TCV discharge as a reference case. In this study, the 3D bounce-averaged Fokker-Planck code LUKE is used to model electron distributions in two electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) experiments. The synthetic spectra generated using the combined LUKE-YODA framework successfully reproduce the main features of the experimental VECE measurements in both simulated discharges. The combination of kinetic and synthetic ECE simulations allow the identification of the features in the electron distribution function which give rise to certain signatures in the VECE signal.",

The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses.

    "title": "Electron Acceleration via Lower-Hybrid Drift Instability in Astrophysical Plasmas: Dependence on Plasma Beta and Suprathermal Electron Distributions",
    "abstract": "Density inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, particularly at magnetic reconnection sites, shock fronts, and within compressible turbulence. The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous plasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma instabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably, lower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma environments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies have primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these regions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of LHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized media, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster plasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical settings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized by the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal electrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we determine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable efficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of instability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further analyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm these critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is generally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\\beta < 1$). However, the presence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration via LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\\beta > 1$). Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in electron acceleration across diverse plasma environments.",

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly flexible and data-efficient intelligent control systems for future fusion reactors.",

If implemented, dephasingless acceleration would allow for a hitherto unachievable mixture of high acceleration gradients and long acceleration lengths. Here, we conduct an in-depth study of the structure and behavior of such a flying-focus wakefield, through a combination of direct imaging and simulations. We show the stability of the wakefield structures, explore how the wakefield evolves with changes of density, study the effects of ionization on the wakefield structure with a variety of gases, and analyze the importance of the focusing position. These insights shed light onto this novel wakefield regime and bring understanding that is important to the realization of dephasingless acceleration.",

For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes.

Given such conditions, the wave propagating through the plasma experiences modulational instability. In this paper, we investigate this instability using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In the relativistic limit, the motion of ions can be neglected due to their significant inertia, allowing us to treat the ions as a background fluid. This simplification enables us to apply perturbation techniques to the electron fluid equations, leading to the derivation of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of the Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Equation (NLSE). We also explore the relationship between wave dispersion and the conditions for instability. We derive the maximum growth rate of the modulational instability and analyze its dependence on plasma parameters and wave intensity in the context of relativistic magnetized plasma, providing quantitative insights into the instability dynamics. Finally, we examine aspects of the perturbed NLSE using the Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky perturbation approach, treating real and imaginary coefficients separately, which explicitly incorporates both Nonlinear Landau Damping (NLLD) and growth-damping effects.",

    "abstract": "Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most present stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: the first for the equilibrium and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. It is challenging to find a compromise between plasma and coils with this approach. In recent years, single-stage approaches have gained popularity, which attempt to optimize both the plasma and coils simultaneously to improve the plasma-coil balance. In exchange, it can substantially increase the problem's dimensionality and introduce the ill-posedness of filamentary coil optimization to equilibrium optimization. This paper introduces a new ``quasi-single-stage'' method representing a flexible and differentiable coil proxy that directly predicts coil complexity during equilibrium optimization. The proxy is based on the adjoint differentiation of a winding surface coil subproblem. Our proxy can balance coil and plasma performance without introducing new degrees of freedom or ill-posedness. We present initial numerical results that demonstrate the proxy's effectiveness for single-stage optimization.",

    "abstract": "A large-scale database of two-dimensional UEDGE simulations has been developed to study detachment physics in KSTAR and to support surrogate models for control applications. Nearly 70,000 steady-state solutions were generated, systematically scanning upstream density, input power, plasma current, impurity fraction, and anomalous transport coefficients, with magnetic and electric drifts across the magnetic field included. The database identifies robust detachment indicators, with strike-point electron temperature at detachment onset consistently Te around 3-4 eV, largely insensitive to upstream conditions. Scaling relations reveal weaker impurity sensitivity than one-dimensional models and show that heat flux widths follow Eich's scaling only for uniform, low D and Chi. Distinctive in-out divertor asymmetries are observed in KSTAR, differing qualitatively from DIII-D. Complementary time-dependent simulations quantify plasma response to gas puffing, with delays of 5-15 ms at the outer strike point and approximately 40 ms for the low-magnetic-field-side (LFS) radiation front. These dynamics are well captured by first-order-plus-dead-time (FOPDT) models and are consistent with experimentally observed detachment-control behavior in KSTAR [Gupta et al., submitted to Plasma Phys.

The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant.

Mainly focusing on the case of waves generated by a periodic driver, we perform a detailed study of the dependence of the wavenumbers and damping rates on the ionization degree of the plasma, the strength of the collisional coupling, and the angle of propagation. We describe how the different wave modes (fast, slow, acoustic) are related to the individual properties of each fluid in a wide range of physical conditions. In addition, we derive analytical approximations for the damping rates due to charge-neutral collisions in the limits of weak and strong coupling and check their range of validity in comparison with the exact numerical results. These approximations can be generally applied to a large variety of astrophysical and laboratory partially ionized plasmas, but here we also discuss the particular application to plasmas only composed of hydrogen.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a multiscale phenomenon where fluid- and particle-scale processes interact. The particle-in-cell (PIC) method, capable of resolving kinetic (particle-scale) physics, is extensively used to study the kinetic effects in magnetic reconnection. Meanwhile, because of the high computational cost, PIC simulations cannot capture the interaction between kinetic and fluid dynamics, which poses a major obstacle to understanding magnetic reconnection in large-scale phenomena such as solar flares. A multi-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC provides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps. We developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And Magnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD simulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are solved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we conducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem. The results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated in the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale structures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability of our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the KAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find that the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the PIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the spatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \\sim 100 \\lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.",

In the model, we consider the ion-neutral collision and thereby consider the collision enhanced ion current to the dust-charging process and dust charge fluctuations. We show that the streaming of the positive-ion beam significantly affects the dust-charging process in which the dust charge number decreases (increases) with an increased beam velocity (number density). Using the standard reductive perturbation technique, we derive the evolution equations in the form of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations for DIA solitary waves for two different cases: nonadiabatic and adiabatic dust charge variations. We study the effect of positive ion beam, dust charge variation, magnetic field, ion creation, and ion-neutral collision enhanced current on the wave characteristics. We find that the soliton energy decays with time and is affected by the beam velocity. Also, the solitary waves get damped by the effects of ion creation, ion loss, ion-neutral collision enhanced current, and dust charge variation. Although the ion beam does not change the polarity of solitary waves in the case of adiabatic dust charge variation, a transition from rarefactive to compressive solitary waves occurs in the presence of an ion beam with nonadiabatic dust charge variation.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses transport barrier formation and layering as consequences of jam formation. Extensive use is made of analogies with the theory of traffic flow in one dimension. The relation of flux jamming to motility induced phase separation (MIPS) is explained. Two routes to heat flux jamming are identified. The first is due to a rollover in the heat flux-pulse size relation, i.e. $dQ_T(\\delta T)/d\\delta T<0$, and is similar to the condition of flux-gradient bistability. The second occurs when the delay time between pulse and heat flux exceeds a critical value. This does not require bistability and tends to occur near marginality. This analysis yields an estimate of the answer to the eternal question of 'how near is \"near\"?'. Staircase development is shown to follow jamiton train formation. The relation of jamming of avalanches to phase transitions in drift wave-zonal flow turbulence is elucidated. The formation of outward propagating blob trains and inward propagating void trains is demonstrated. The important role of turbulence spreading is identified.",

    "title": "Kinetic Scale Energy Budget in Turbulent Plasmas: Role of Electron to Ion Temperature Ratio",
    "abstract": "The dissipation mechanisms in weakly collisional plasmas have been a longstanding topic of investigation, where significant progress has been made in recent years. A recent promising development is the use of the \"scale-filtered\" Vlasov-Maxwell equations to fully quantify the scale-by-scale energy balance, a feature that was absent when using fluid models in kinetic plasmas. In particular, this method reveals that the energy transfer in kinetic scales is fully accounted for by the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction. Despite this progress, the influence of ion-electron thermal disequilibrium on the kinetic-scale energy budget remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of decaying plasma turbulence, we systematically investigate the pressure-strain interaction and its components at sub-ion scales by varying electron-to-ion temperature ratios. Our analysis focuses on three key ingredients of the pressure-strain interaction: the normal and shear components of Pi-D and pressure dilatation. Our results demonstrate that the scale-filtered pressure-strain interaction is dominated by scale-filtered Pi-D across the kinetic range, with the shear component consistently providing the dominant contribution. We find that the scale-filtered normal and shear contributions of Pi-D exhibit persistent anticorrelation and opposite signs across all kinetic scales. We also discover that the amplitude of both anisotropic components for each species scales directly with their temperature and inversely with the temperature of the other species, while the scale-filtered pressure dilatation remains negligible compared to the Pi-D terms but shows enhanced compressibility effects as plasma temperatures decrease. We discuss the implications of these findings in thermally non-equilibrated plasmas, such as in the turbulent magnetosheath and solar wind.",

The two 3D Mach probes are composed of regular polyhedral arrays of six and four tips, respectively, with the six-tip array composed of three orthogonal pairs of mutually opposite tips at the vertices of a regular octahedron and the four-tip array composed of non-opposite tips at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, the analysis of which is specifically facilitated by the matrix method. Velocity measurement uncertainties for the Mach probes are derived based on uncertainties in probe machining and ion saturation current measurements, and typical relative uncertainties for the probes are estimated to be of order several percent, likely smaller than systematic uncertainties related to the Mach probe calibration constant and experimental uncertainties related to plasma and probe conditioning. Initial results for the octahedral probe show flow speeds of roughly the expected magnitudes based on previous MST measurements but with somes differences in flow direction, while those for the tetrahedron probe show similar flow directions to some previous measurements but also some larger than expected speeds. We consider possible causes for the unexpected results of these initial tests, with a focus on probe conditioning and fast electron issues.",

    "abstract": "Flying focus techniques produce laser pulses whose focal points travel at arbitrary, controllable velocities. While this flexibility can enhance a broad range of laser-based applications, existing techniques constrain the motion of the focal point to the propagation direction of the pulse. Here, we introduce a flying focus configuration that decouples the motion of the focus from the propagation direction. A chirped laser pulse focused and diffracted by a diffractive lens and grating creates a focal point that can move both along and transverse to the propagation direction. The focal length of the lens, grating period, and chirp can be tuned to control the direction and velocity of the focus. Simulations demonstrate this control for a holographic configuration suited to high-power pulses, in which two off-axis pump beams with different focal lengths encode the equivalent phase of a chromatic lens and grating in a gas or plasma. For low-power pulses, conventional solid-state or adaptive optics can be used instead. Multi-dimensional control over the focal trajectory enables new configurations for applications, including laser wakefield acceleration of ions, steering of broadband THz radiation, and surface harmonic generation.",

Unlike research-oriented devices, FPPs must operate with a severely constrained set of diagnostics. To address this challenge, we demonstrate that a minimalist model, using only electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals, can deliver accurate and reliable state classification. ECE provides electron temperature profiles without the engineering or survivability issues of in-vessel probes, making it a primary candidate for FPP-relevant diagnostics. Our framework employs ECE as input, extracts features with radial basis functions, and applies a gradient boosting classifier, achieving high accuracy with test accuracy averaging 96\\% correct predictions. Robustness analysis and feature importance study confirm the reliability of the approach. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art performance is attainable from a restricted diagnostic set, paving the way for minimalist yet resilient plasma control architectures for FPPs.",

    "abstract": "We revisit and invalidate all dark photon dark matter constraints from resonant conversion of dark photons into photons (plasmons) in the early universe. These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts into $k \\simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma. Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma, nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds. Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of $3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.",

    "abstract": "We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.",

    "abstract": "We present a unified theoretical framework for induced (stimulated) scattering-parametric instabilities of electromagnetic waves, including induced Compton, stimulated Brillouin, and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma. By solving the dispersion relations derived from kinetic theory, taking into account the ponderomotive force due to the beat of incident and scattered waves, we obtain analytical expressions for the linear growth rates of the ordinary, neutral, and charged modes of density fluctuations. Our results clarify which type of scattering dominates under different thermal coupling, resonance, and density conditions. In strong magnetic fields, scattering of perpendicularly polarized waves is generally suppressed, but by different powers of the cyclotron frequency. Moreover, SRS, which is forbidden in unmagnetized electron and positron pair plasma, becomes possible in the charged mode. This framework enables a comprehensive evaluation of induced scattering in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasma, such as fast radio burst (FRB) emission and propagation in magnetar magnetospheres.",

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of core instabilities in tokamak plasmas is essential to understand the underlying physical mechanisms and their impact on plasma confinement. The ideal stability of the internal kink mode and the m = 1 collisionless tearing mode are analyzed numerically both with gyrokinetic and MHD codes. We compare the different models implemented in the codes and show that the gyrokinetic equations without collisions inherently contain the ideal MHD limit. The simulation results show that the stability of the internal kink mode strongly depends on the choice of several setup parameters like the inclusion of parallel magnetic field fluctuations, the tokamak aspect ratio, the drift- or gyrokinetic treatment of the ions and the electron mass. Furthermore, we demonstrate the stabilization of the instabilities by diamagnetic effects. Our results indicate that gyrokinetic and MHD models can be reconciled in the description of the internal kink mode by careful consideration of the simulation setup and model assumptions, but instabilities like the collisionless tearing mode require a more advanced treatment beyond MHD.",

    "abstract": "Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.",

Within the framework where the magnetic field is everywhere parallel to the flow velocity, we give an effective decomposition of the steady MHD equations in terms of the deformation tensor and the modified vorticity, where the modification in the vorticity is to record the effect of the Lorentz force on the velocity field.

    "abstract": "Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak \\`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \\times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.",

Consistent with earlier, lower-resolution studies, we find that overall flow dynamics remain very similar between ideal and non-ideal models. For the first time, we synthesize images and spectra of SgrA* from weakly collisional models -- assuming an isotropic, thermal population of electrons -- and find that these remain largely indistinguishable from ideal fluid predictions. However, most weakly collisional models exhibit lower light curve variability, with all magnetically dominated models showing a small but systematic decrease in variability.",

    "abstract": "High-intensity laser plasma interactions create complex computational problems because they involve both fluid and kinetic regimes, which need models that maintain physical precision while keeping computational speed. The research introduces a machine learning-based three-dimensional hybrid fluid-particle-in-cell (PIC) system, which links relativistic plasma behavior to automatic regime transitions. The technique employs fluid approximations for stable areas but activates the PIC solver when SwitchNet directs it to unstable sections through its training on physics-based synthetic data. The model uses a smooth transition between Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling and multiphoton ionization rates to simulate ionization, while Airy-function approximations simulate quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects for radiation reaction and pair production. The convolutional neural network applies energy conservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized fields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The hybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination (R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field components. This adaptive approach enhances the accuracy and scalability of laser-plasma simulations, providing a unified predictive framework for high-energy-density and particle acceleration applications.",

As a showcase, this approach enables {\\it ab initio} calculations of the thermal and electrical conductivities of Aluminum (Al) up to 1000 eV.

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection, often accompanied by turbulence interaction, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical environments. However, the current understanding of the nature of turbulent magnetic reconnection remains insufficient. We investigate the statistical properties of reconnection turbulence in the framework of the self-driven reconnection. Using the open-source software package AMUN, we first perform numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection. We then obtain the statistical results of reconnection turbulence by traditional statistical methods such as the power spectrum and structure function. Our numerical results demonstrate: (1) the velocity spectrum of reconnection turbulence follows the classical Kolmogorov type of $E\\propto k^{-5/3}$, while the magnetic field spectrum is steeper than the Kolmogorov spectrum, which are independent of limited resistivity, guide field, and isothermal or adiabatic fluid states; (2) most of the simulations show the anisotropy cascade, except that the presence of a guide field leads to an isotropic cascade; (3) reconnection turbulence is incompressible in the adiabatic state, with energy distribution dominated by the velocity solenoidal component; (4) different from pure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the intermittency of the velocity field is stronger than that of the magnetic field in reconnection turbulence. The steep magnetic field spectrum, together with the velocity spectrum of Kolmogorov type, can characterize the feature of the reconnection turbulence. In the case of the presence of the guide field, the isotropy of the reconnection turbulence cascade is also different from the cascade mode of pure MHD turbulence. Our experimental results provide new insights into the properties of reconnection turbulence, which will contribute to advancing the self-driven reconnection theory.",

These rates depend non-linearly on local density and temperature, and are thus sensitive to turbulent fluctuations. We present an analysis of atomic rates and their dependence on turbulent fluctuations, obtained from GRILLIX edge turbulence simulations in detached divertor conditions. Ionization, recombination and radiation rates are evaluated in turbulent and corresponding mean-field states, and their differences are discussed. While the effect is minimal in attached conditions with low fluctuation amplitudes (< 50% of the background), pronounced discrepancies emerge in detached conditions with high fluctuation amplitudes (> 300% of the background). Local ionization and radiation rates obtained from turbulent inputs are up to a factor of ~2 lower than rates obtained from mean-field inputs. The rate reduction is the result of the particular anti-correlation of electron density and temperature in detached conditions. When factoring out correlations, the turbulent rate approximately recovers to the mean-field rate. When arranged to correlate positively, the turbulent ionization rate instead increases by a factor of ~3. Our results demonstrate that the common method of evaluating rates with mean-field plasma inputs can introduce systematic errors to particle and energy balances, particularly in detached conditions.",

Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged: it is characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and non-reciprocal interactions play a pivotal role in destabilizing the bilayer structure. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.",

We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.",

    "title": "Statistics of Current and Vorticity Structures in Relativistic Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Coherent structures created through turbulent cascades play a key role in energy dissipation and particle acceleration. In this work, we investigate both current and vorticity sheets in 3D particle-in-cell simulations of decaying relativistic turbulence in pair plasma by training a self-organizing map to recognize these structures. We subsequently carry out an extensive statistical analysis to reveal their geometric and structural properties. This analysis is systematically applied across a range of magnetizations ($\\sigma$) and fluctuating-to-mean magnetic field strengths ($\\delta B_0/B_0$) to assess how these parameters influence the resulting structures. We find that the structures' geometric properties form power-law distributions in their probability density functions (PDFs), with the exception of the structure width, which generally exhibits an exponential distribution peaking around 2 electron skin depths. The measurements show weak dependence on $\\sigma$ but a strong dependence on $\\delta B_0/B_0$. Finally, we investigate the spatial relationship between current sheets and vorticity sheets. We find that most current sheets are directly associated with at least one vorticity sheet neighbor and are often situated between two vorticity sheets. These findings provide a detailed statistical framework for understanding the formation and organization of coherent structures in relativistic magnetized turbulence, allowing for their incorporation into updated theoretical models for structure-based energy dissipation and particle acceleration processes crucial for interpreting high-energy astrophysical observations.",

    "abstract": "High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.",

    "abstract": "Instabilities driven by strong gradients appear in a wide variety of physical systems, including plasmas, neutral fluids, and self-gravitating systems. This work develops an analytic formulation to describe the transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of a discrete, strongly driven instability in the presence of energy sources and sinks. Initially, the mode is found to evolve linearly until the gradient in the distribution has been exhausted. It then transitions to a nonlinear phase governed by a Bernoulli differential equation, for which a closed-form analytic solution is found, and continues to evolve until the energy sources and sinks reach equilibrium. During the nonlinear phase, the leading order distribution function is found to persistently satisfy an advection-diffusion equation in time and energy coordinates. These analytical results are shown to agree closely with nonlinear kinetic simulations and to be readily applicable in the study of resonant transport in plasmas, galaxies and viscous shear flows.",

    "abstract": "Finite-amplitude low-frequency Alfv\\'en waves are commonly found in plasma environments, such as space plasmas, and play a crucial role in ion heating. The nonlinear interaction between oblique Alfv\\'en wave spectra and ions has been studied. As the number of wave modes increases, ions are more likely to exhibit chaotic motion and experience stochastic heating. The stochastic heating threshold in the parameter space can be characterized by a single parameter, the effective relative curvature radius $P_{{eff.}}$. The results show excellent agreement with the chaotic regions identified through test particle simulations. The anisotropic characteristics of stochastic heating are explained using a uniform solid angle distribution model. The stochastic heating rate $Q=\\dot{T}$ is calculated, and its relationship with wave conditions is expressed as $Q/(\\Omega_i m_i v_A^2) = H(\\alpha) \\tilde{v}^3 \\tilde{B}_w^2 \\tilde{\\omega}_1$, where $\\alpha$ is propagating angle, $\\Omega_i$ is the gyrofrequency, $m_i$ is the ion mass, $v_A$ is the Alfv\\'en speed, $\\tilde{v}$ is the dimensionless speed, $\\tilde{B}_w$ is the dimensionless wave amplitude, and $\\tilde{\\omega}_1$ is the lowest dimensionless wave frequency.",

    "abstract": "Near-space, which covers altitudes from 20 to 100 kilometers, has been receiving more and more attention because of its special strategic value. Airships and high-altitude balloons are two common types of low-speed vehicles that operate in this region. They can be used for jobs like monitoring, communication, and remote sensing, but they need efficient propulsion systems to work well. Earlier, we proposed a new type of electric propulsion system that can ionize the surrounding air to create plasma and produce thrust for near-space vehicles. However, in past experiments, not enough was known about how certain parameters affect power absorption and electromagnetic behavior. Therefore, in this study, we used computer simulations to examine how gas pressure (200 to 1000 Pa), input power (200 to 600 W), frequency (13.56 to 52.24 MHz), and different gas types ($Ar$, $N_2$, $H_2$, $He$) influence inductively coupled plasma inside a quartz tube. We especially focused on comparing two antenna designs: one with a single turn and one with five turns. In all the simulations, the single-turn antenna consistently absorbed power better than the five-turns antenna. Higher frequencies significantly influence both plasma power absorption and magnetic field characteristics. The optimal power absorption occurs at a filling gas pressure of 400 Pa. When varying the input power, we observed an initial decrease followed by an increasing trend, which may be related to ionization mechanisms. In comparisons among different gas types, the inelastic collision mechanisms in molecular gases lead to a notable reduction in plasma power absorption efficiency. The results from this work will help guide the design of future experiments for this electric propulsion concept.",

We focus on the relationship of the reconnection properties to the statistics of global turbulent fields. For the first time, we show that the distribution in turbulence of reconnection rates (determined by upstream fields) is strongly correlated with the magnitude of the global turbulent magnetic field at the correlation scale. The average reconnection rates, and associated dissipation rates, during turbulence are thus much larger than predicted by using turbulent magnetic field fluctuation amplitudes at the dissipation or kinetic scales. Magnetic reconnection may therefore be playing a major role in energy dissipation in astrophysical and heliospheric turbulence.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport. GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.",

In this study, we examine the nonlinear interactions between monochromatic AWs and ions. When the wave amplitude and propagation angle lie within certain ranges, particle motion becomes chaotic. We quantify this chaotic behavior using the maximum Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda_m$, and find that chaos depends on the particles' initial states. To characterize the proportion of chaotic particles across different initial states, we introduce the Chaos Ratio ($CR$). The threshold for the onset of global chaos is calculated as the contour line of $CR=0.01$. We analyze changes in the magnetic moment during particle motion and identify the physical image of chaos as pitch-angle scattering caused by wave-induced field line curvature (WFLC). Consequently, the condition for chaos can be expressed as the effective relative curvature radius $P_{eff.}<C$, with $C$ being a constant. We analytically determine the chaos region in the $(k_x,\\,k_z,\\,B_w)$ parameter space, and the results show excellent agreement with the global chaos threshold given by $CR=0.01$.",

Due to the strain sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3) employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels, gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1 (planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2 (non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics, paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.",

    "abstract": "CO$_2$ with an admixture of C$_4$F$_7$N could serve as an eco-friendly alternative to the extreme greenhouse gas SF$_6$ in high-voltage insulation. Streamer discharges in such gases are different from those in air due to the rapid conductivity decay in the streamer channels. Furthermore, since no effective photoionisation mechanism is known, we expect discharge growth to be more stochastic than in air. In this paper we investigate whether conventional fluid models can be used to simulate streamers in CO$_2$ with admixtures of C$_4$F$_7$N of 1 or 10%. We focus on 3D simulations of negative streamers. First we review cross section databases for C$_4$F$_7$N and CO$_2$. Then we compare a two-term Boltzmann solver with a Monte Carlo method to compute reaction and transport coefficients from the cross sections. Afterwards we compare 3D fluid simulations with the local field (LFA) or local energy approximation (LEA) against particle simulations. In general, we find that the results of particle and fluid models are quite similar. One difference we observe is that particle simulations are intrinsically stochastic, leading to more branching. Furthermore, the LEA model does not show better agreement with the particle simulations than the LFA model. We also discuss the effect and choice of different boundary conditions on the negative rod electrode.",

Regarding (1), we argue that the main geometric quantities of interest are the notion of reach and the volume of the region enclosed by the coils.

This paper investigates the influence of solar sails on the ambient magnetic field, particularly focusing on two critical electromagnetic effects: eddy currents and magnetic pileup. We find the induced eddy currents in the metallic sail can significantly perturb the local magnetic field at high frequencies. We also suggest that magnetic pileup can influence the spacecraft's environment when the sail size is comparable to the electron kinetic scales of the surrounding plasma.

Heating occurs intermittently at discrete locations on the chromospheric surface, modeled through a surface coarse-graining procedure that produces non-thermal boundary conditions for the Vlasov equation. The resulting stationary distribution functions generate suprathermal particle populations and naturally lead to a temperature inversion via gravitational filtering, without any local coronal heating. The model reproduces realistic temperature and density profiles with a thin transition region and a hot corona, consistent with solar observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial intermittency of heating at the chromospheric interface is sufficient to account for the formation of the transition region and the high-temperature corona.",

In electrostatic cases, LHDI remains localized at the sheet edges, flattening density gradients. In electromagnetic regimes, turbulence induced by LHDI generates magnetic perturbations that kink the current sheet and enhance anomalous resistivity.

Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.",

    "abstract": "High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) offers higher ionized flux fractions at the cost of lower deposition rates compared to conventional DCMS. A fine optimization of the deposition conditions is crucial for specific applications. Chopped or multi-pulse HiPIMS (segmenting pulses into shorter micropulses) has been proposed to mitigate ion back-attraction and promote working gas recovery. This study investigates how micropulse length, delay time between segments, and magnetic field strength influence energy flux, deposition rate, and ionized flux fraction in chopped and standard HiPIMS. These quantities are evaluated by passive thermal probe, biasable QCM and mass spectrometer measurements at the substrate position. Deposition-averaged and pulse-averaged power is kept constant for all conditions to facilitate meaningful comparison. Results indicate that chopping the HiPIMS pulse consistently leads to higher energy flux and total deposition rate compared to standard HiPIMS at the same total pulse length, primarily due to increased ion flux. A weaker unbalanced magnetic field configuration enhances deposition rates and ion transport. In chopped HiPIMS, increasing micropulse length decreased energy flux and deposition rates, whereas increasing the delay time between micropulses substantially improved these parameters. Importantly, standard HiPIMS, which operated at higher frequencies and short pulse lengths, demonstrated superior performance (with higher total energy and particle fluxes) than chopped HiPIMS when compared at similar short pulse durations. This suggests that consistent short pulse durations and sufficient off-times for complete gas refill are paramount for maximizing ion fluxes and deposition rates.",

    "abstract": "The neoclassical baseline study of a strongly negative triangularity (NT) plasma and the corresponding positive triangularity plasma is performed using the edge-specialized, total-f gyrokinetic code XGC. A DIII-D-like plasma is used, based on the negative triangularity discharge of DIII-D \\#193793. An artificial positive triangularity (PT) equilibrium has been constructed to compare the edge rotation physics at the same triangularity strength, but with opposite sign, while keeping the same elongation and other geometric parameters. Carbon(+6) ions are added to the deuterium plasma at an experimentally relevant level. By using the experimental profile of carbon toroidal rotation profile as an input, XGC finds that the deuteron rotation is significantly different from the carbon rotation at the inboard and outboard midplanes, mostly caused by the difference in the Pfirsch-Schluter rotation. More importantly, significant difference in the X-point orbit loss physics, thus the rotation source, is found between the positive and negative triangularity equilibrium models. However, it is also found that the agreement between the present neoclassical simulation and the experimental NT data is validated only within the middle of pedestal slope, indicating the importance of edge turbulence. This study could establish baseline for the multiphysics, multiscale studies that include turbulence of negative triangularity plasmas.",

Our analysis focuses on the blowout regime, where the plasma response is highly non-linear: plasma electrons are radially blown out and expelled away from the propagation axis of the beam particles, creating a region (bubble) of ions without electrons. Our study builds upon earlier investigations for non-linear models of plasma wakefields developed neglecting plasma temperature. In the presence of a non-zero background temperature, we characterize the bubble in terms of its transversal and longitudinal sizes as a function of the temperature. Model predictions and parametrizations are studied in combination with PIC simulations, and correctly reproduce the temperature induced contraction of both the longitudinal and transverse bubble sizes.",

    "abstract": "Electrospray thrusters are emerging as a leading propulsion technology for CubeSats, offering high specific impulse ($I_{sp} > 1000$ s) and low power requirements. However, the divergent ion plumes can impinge on spacecraft surfaces, particularly body-mounted solar arrays, causing contamination and thrust efficiency losses. This study presents a validated particle-tracking simulation to quantify the effects of thruster placement on thrust efficiency and surface contamination for 1U, 3U, and 6U CubeSats. The plume model employs a cosine power distribution ($k=1.8$) with half-angle $46^\\circ$, validated against experimental data with errors below 7%. Results show that thrust efficiency ranges from 53.6% for rear-mounted thrusters on 3U body-mounted configurations to 100% for side-mounted configurations with deployable arrays. CubeSat size significantly affects impingement: 3U platforms experience 46.4% contamination with rear-mounted thrusters compared to 16.6% for 1U. Deployable solar arrays reduce contamination by 77% compared to body-mounted arrays, while side-mounted thrusters eliminate impingement entirely at the cost of only 1.6% efficiency loss. Corner-mounted configurations at $30^\\circ$ cant provide intermediate performance with 88.9% efficiency and 11.1% contamination. These quantitative design guidelines enable mission planners to optimize thruster integration based on power budget and propellant mass constraints, with statistical uncertainty below 0.15% across all configurations.",

Using two- and three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the OSIRIS 4.0 framework, it is shown that a shaped magnetized plasma lens (MPL) can act as a glass/solid-state-based convex lens, amplifying laser intensity via transverse focusing. Moreover, by integrating three key ingredients, a tailored plasma lens geometry, a spatially structured strong magnetic field, and a suitably chirped laser pulse, simultaneous focusing and compression of the pulse has been achieved. The simulations reveal up to a 100-fold increase in laser intensity, enabled by the combined action of the MPL and the chirped pulse profile. With recent advances in high-field magnet technology, shaped plasma targets, and controlled chirped laser systems, this approach offers a promising pathway toward experimentally reaching extreme intensities.",

The energy spectra of our forced MHD simulations on $8192^2$, $4096^2$, $1024^3$, and $512^3$ support Kolmogorov's k^{-5/3} spectrum over Iroshnikov-Kraichnan's k^{-3/2} spectrum, but the difference in the spectral exponents is small. However, the numerically computed third-order structure functions and intermittency exponents support Kolmogorov scaling in both two and three dimensions. Also, the energy fluxes of the imbalance MHD follow the predictions of Kolmogorov scaling. These results would help in better modelling of solar wind, solar corona, and dynamos.",

    "abstract": "We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python package $\\texttt{STRUPHY}$. Numerical experiments confirm the energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\\'en eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.",

To date, a simplified and accurate theory that can be easily integrated has not been available. This limitation affects modeling in inertial confinement fusion and magnetic confinement fusion systems, among others, where non-local transport is well-known to be present. Here, we present a coupling methodology between a full Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) electron kinetic code and radiation-hydrodynamics (rad-hydro) codes. The VFP code is used to adjust native electron transport in the rad-hydro code, thus enabling improved transport without the need to integrate a full electron VFP solver into the rad-hydro code. This approach necessitates only occasional invocation of the VFP code, reducing computational intensity compared to following the dynamic evolution entirely with the VFP code on fluid time scales. We illustrate that the methodology is more accurate than other simplified methods in thermal decay systems relevant to inertial confinement fusion and can replicate standard theoretical results with high accuracy.",

We present a first-principles numerical approach to obtaining scattered light signals of ion acoustic features with high resolution in angle and frequency space using particle-in-cell simulations under typical ICF conditions. Our method demonstrates good agreement with existing theories for thermal collective TS. In the super-thermal collective regime, the results align with theory when the driven plasma modes are well-matched in wave vectors to the probe and collecting beams. Moreover, we also find that TS signals can remain significant even under imperfect wave-vector matching-a result that contradicts the conventional expectation that the TS spectrum strictly follows the plasma density spectrum. We attribute this discrepancy to a beating wave mechanism arising from the interaction between the probe beam and driven plasma density modulations. Our work thus provides a practical framework for interpreting TS signals from driven ion modes, a common yet complex feature in ICF plasmas.",

It is highly useful as a non-perturbing, in-situ measure of the gross erosion flux of plasma-facing components (PFCs). In sheared-flow-stabilized (SFS) Z-pinch devices, the electrode supplies the plasma current and directly contacts the core Z-pinch plasma. Electrode erosion due to the large particle and heat fluxes affects electrode durability, which is an important factor in existing and future devices. An improved understanding of these plasma-electrode interactions is required, in particular as energy density increases. Experiments on the ZaP-HD device investigate erosion of the graphite electrode by applying the S/XB method for C-III emission at 229.7 nm. The S/XB coefficients are determined from electron density and temperature profiles obtained from Digital Holographic Interferometry (DHI) measurements. An approach for expanding these profiles to represent plasma contacting the electrode is described. In both cases, the measured erosion fluxes are on the order of 10$^{30}$-10$^{31}$ atoms m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. These values are significantly larger than the expected erosion flux due to physical sputtering of H$^+$ ions on carbon, but are comparable to theoretical sublimation fluxes. This suggests that the source of carbon erosion flux is primarily from sublimation as opposed to sputtering. The dominance of sublimation over sputtering processes implies a difference in energy of the eroded neutrals which may provide insight on redeposition and net erosion behavior.",

We describe here the experimental demonstration of off-axis diffractive gaseous lenses capable of withstanding extreme laser fluence and immune to cumulative damage. We used less than 8 mJ of energy from interfering ultraviolet laser pulses to holographically write millimeter-scale diffractive gas lenses into an ozone, oxygen, and carbon-dioxide gas mixture. These lenses allowed us to focus, defocus, and collimate 532-nm nanosecond laser pulses with up to 210 mJ of energy at efficiencies above 50% and fluences up to 35 J/cm$^2$. We also show that the gas lenses have sufficient bandwidth to efficiently diffract 35-fs 800-nm pulses and that beam pointing, divergence, and diffraction efficiency are stable while operating at 10 Hz. These diffractive lenses are simple holograms, and the principles demonstrated here could be extended to other types of optics, suggesting that gaseous optics may enable arbitrary, damage-resistant manipulation of intense light for next-generation ultra-high-power lasers.",

    "title": "Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-Identified Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates",
    "abstract": "Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of the size of nanoparticles is an essential task in plasma technology and dusty plasmas. Light scattering techniques, based on Mie theory, can be used as a non-invasive and in-situ diagnostic tool for this purpose. However, the standard back-calculation methods require expertise from the user. To address this, we introduce a neural network that performs the same task. We discuss how we set up and trained the network to analyze the size of plasma-grown amorphous carbon nanoparticles (a:C-H) with a refractive index n in the range of real(n) = 1.4-2.2 and imag(n) = 0.04i-0.1i and a radius of up to several hundred nanometers, depending on the used wavelength. The diagnostic approach is kinetic, which means that the particles need to change in size due to growth or etching. An uncertainty analysis as well as a test with experimental data are presented. Our neural network achieves results that agree with those of prior fitting algorithms while offering higher methodical stability. The model also holds a major advantage in terms of computing speed and automation.",

    "abstract": "Computer aided engineering of multi-time-scale plasma systems which exhibit a quasi-steady state solution are challenging due to the large number of time steps required to reach convergence. Machine learning techniques combined with traditional first-principles simulations and high-performance computing offer many interesting pathways towards resolving this challenge. We consider acceleration of kinetic plasma simulations via machine learning generated initial conditions. The approach is demonstrated through modeling of capacitively coupled plasma discharges relevant to the microelectronics industry. Three models are trained on simulations across a parameter space of device driving frequency and operating pressure. The models incorporate elements of a multi-layer perceptron, principal component analysis, and convolutional neural networks to predict the final time-averaged profiles of ion-density and velocity distribution functions. These data-driven initial condition generators (ICGs) provide a mean speedup of 17.1x in convergence time, when measured using an offline procedure, or a 4.4x speedup with an online procedure, with convolutional neural networks leading to the best performance. The paper also outlines a workflow for continuous data-driven model improvement and simulation speedup, with the aim of generating sufficient data for full device digital twins.",

    "abstract": "X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the inverse cascade of magnetic energy in decaying, collisionless plasmas with moderate to high-$\\beta$ values via first-principles numerical simulations and analytical theory. We find that pressure-anisotropy-driven instabilities, in particular the firehose instability, suppress reconnection-driven coalescence of magnetic structures (i.e., inverse transfer) by nullifying magnetic tension. This suppression leaves such structures elongated and confined to scales comparable to the Larmor radius of the particles. The presence of a magnetic guide field of sufficient strength, or a greater scale separation between the initial size of the magnetic structures and the Larmor radius, restores the system's ability to inverse transfer magnetic energy. These results reveal that inverse energy transfer in collisionless plasmas is not guaranteed, but instead sensitively depends on magnetization. In the astrophysical context, this identifies a kinetic mechanism by which Weibel-generated seed fields may fail to merge consistently, potentially limiting their role in cosmic magnetogenesis.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \\le S \\le 2 \\times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \\& Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \\sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.",

Furthermore, we present recent developments that enable the determination of the absolute normalization, Rayleigh weight, and density from XRTS measurements without reliance on uncontrolled model assumptions.

    "abstract": "The current study belongs to the field of applied mathematics in plasma physics and electric power, where mathematical analysis of the algebraic equations governing the electric field vector, and the electric-current density field vector within a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) linear two-dimensional divergent supersonic channel is utilized to derive analytical expressions for these important fields, as well as closed-form equations for the volumetric power density (output electric power per unit volume of the plasma channel). The expressions presented here describe analytically the operation of the MHD channel as an electric power source within an Open-Cycle Magnetohydrodynamic (OCMHD) generator. The four common types of the MHD linear channels are covered here: namely, (1) continuous-electrode Faraday channel, (2) linear Hall channel, (3) segmented-electrode Faraday channel, and (4) diagonal-electrode channel. The mathematical results, their detailed derivation, and the companion graphical illustrations aid in making a proper decision regarding which channel type is the most suitable for a given application.Under typical operational conditions of 5 S/m plasma electric conductivity, 5 T magnetic field, and 2,000 m/s plasma speed, as well as an optimized load factor of 0.5, we estimate the following numerical values (unsigned magnitudes) for the continuous-electrode Faraday channel (with a Hall parameter of 1): useful electric field (across the external electric load): 5 kV/m, useful electric current-density (between the terminal electrodes within the channel): 12.5 kA/m2 , volumetric power density (dissipated by the load per unit volume of plasma): 62.5 MW/m3 , and electric efficiency (for the electric field or voltage): 50%. For the Halllinear channel (with a Hall parameter of 5), these quantitative performance values become25 kV/m, 4.808 kA/m2, 120.19 MW/m3, and 46.30%.",

These studies provide essential inputs to astrophysics as well as high-energy density physics. This is reflected in the contributions to this festshrift in his honour. The electron-proton system becomes particularly difficult for theoretical modeling when the temperature becomes comparable to the Fermi energy $E_F$, when the warm-dense matter (WDM) state of hydrogen is reached. In this study we briefly review the theoretical methods available for the study of WDM systems, and use the neutral-pseudo atom (NPA) method, and a classical map for quantum electrons to study fully and partially ionized hydrogen. It is shown that {\\it both} fully and partially ionized states can independently exist at the {\\it same density and temperature} in many cases. Recent studies using path-integral Monte Carlo methods, and $N$-atom Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have provided essential structure data including the electron-electron structure factor $S_{ee}(k)$ that enters into interpretation of X-ray Thomson scattering and other diagnostics. We show that these structure data can be rapidly and inexpensively evaluated, with sufficient accuracy, using classical-map schemes for fully ionized plasmas, and more generally, using one-atom (average-atom) DFT methods for partially ionized systems.",

Electron pressure plays an important role in generalized Ohm's law, competing with electron inertia. This model is used in the development of a surrogate model for a fully kinetic energy-conserving semi-implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation of decaying magnetosheath turbulence. We achieve this by training FCNN on a representative set of simulations with a smaller number of particles per cell and showing that our results generalise to a simulation with a large number of particles per cell. We evaluate the statistical properties of the learned equation of state, with a focus on pressure-strain interaction, which is crucial for understanding energy channels in turbulent plasmas. The resulting equation of state learned via FCNN significantly outperforms local closures, such as those learned by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or double adiabatic expressions. We report that the overall spatial distribution of pressure-strain and its conditional averages are reconstructed well. However, some small-scale features are missed, especially for the off-diagonal components of the pressure tensor. Nevertheless, the results are substantially improved with more training data, indicating favorable scaling and potential for improvement, which will be addressed in future work.",

    "abstract": "Achieving tritium self-sufficiency is a critical challenge for future fusion power plants. The BABY 1L experiment, part of the LIBRA project at MIT, aims to benchmark tritium breeding and release in molten salt breeder systems under deuterium-tritium (DT) neutron irradiation. Building on the initial \\SI{100}{mL} campaign, BABY 1L introduces a tenfold increase in breeder volume, improved thermal and gas handling systems, and enhanced neutron diagnostics, including a proton recoil telescope. We report on results from four irradiation experiments using sealed-tube DT neutron generators, with tritium collected by water bubblers measured via liquid scintillation counting. Experimentally determined Tritium Breeding Ratios (TBRs) were compared to OpenMC neutronics simulations, showing very good agreement. The measured TBR values demonstrate a six-fold improvement over the \\SI{100}{mL} experiments, largely attributed to the increased solid angle and improved measurement fidelity. We also investigate tritium release dynamics and identify diffusion-limited transport as the dominant regime in the salt volume in the temperature range 630-750 \\si{\\celsius}. Additionally, we observe that the introduction of hydrogen in the helium carrier gas significantly accelerates tritium release, consistent with an isotopic exchange mechanism. All analysis is conducted through the open-source \\texttt{libra-toolbox} \\cite{libra-toolbox}, which streamlines simulation, data processing, and validation across experimental campaigns. These results provide critical insights into the design and operation of future liquid breeder systems and demonstrate the maturity of the BABY platform as a testbed for tritium breeding studies.",

    "abstract": "The production of high-yield, longitudinally polarized positron beams represents an outstanding challenge in advanced accelerator science. Laser-driven schemes offer a compact alternative but typically yield only transverse polarization, or require pre-polarized electron beams, and struggle to efficiently accelerate positrons to high energies. Here, we introduce an all-optical scheme that overcomes these limitations by integrating positron generation, acceleration, and spin manipulation in a unified framework. Through a head-on collision between an ultraintense, circularly polarized laser pulse and a counterpropagating unpolarized electron beam, we drive a robust QED cascade. The nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process within the cascade produces positrons that are born directly within the strong laser field. Crucially, these positrons are instantaneously captured and accelerated to multi-GeV energies (up to $\\sim$9 GeV) via a direct laser acceleration mechanism, while their spins are simultaneously rotated to longitudinal alignment by the field dynamics. Our Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the simultaneous achievement of a high positron yield ($\\sim$20 $e^+/e^-$), a high average longitudinal polarization ($\\sim$50\\%), and GeV-scale energies. This all-optical source, feasible at upcoming ultraintense laser facilities, presents a compact and efficient solution for applications in collider physics and fundamental high-energy experiments.",

Backed up by first-of-a-kind linear and nonlinear simulations, we find that alpha particle-driven Alfv\\'enic modes cause only negligible depolarization, which is contrary to expectations in prior literature. Other Alfv\\'enic instabilities can in principle degrade polarization, but only under conditions unlikely to be realized on transport timescales. By combining full-orbit particle tracing with a dedicated depolarization solver, we demonstrate that wave-driven depolarization is surprisingly weak in SPARC and ITER-scale devices. These results provide strong evidence that spin-polarized fuel can maintain its polarization long enough to boost fusion reactivity, opening a viable path toward substantially enhanced performance in magnetic confinement fusion power plants.",

Recent computational advances, at the level of both algorithmics and hardware, have enabled high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to span multiple scales, offering new insights into magnetic energy dissipation processes. Here, we study scale invariance of magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. Current sheets are identified and analyzed over time. Results demonstrate that dissipative events exhibit scale invariance, with power-law distributions characterizing their energy dissipation and lifetimes. Remarkably, these distributions are consistent across the two simulations, despite differing numerical and physical setups, suggesting universality in the process of magnetic energy dissipation. Comparisons between the evolution of dissipation regions reveals distinct growth behaviors in high plasma-beta regions (convective zone) and low plasma-beta regions (atmosphere). The latter display spatiotemporal dynamics similar to those of avalanche models, suggesting self-organized criticality and a common universality class.",

    "abstract": "Laser-accelerated electron bunches and the secondary radiation sources they produce exhibit unique temporal resolution for probing ultrafast physical processes due to their ultrashort pulse duration. The inherently short temporal profile of these pulses leads to extremely high peak bunch currents, thereby enabling a wide range of practical applications. In this study, we propose an innovative method for generating such bunch by utilizing high-harmonics generated through laser-plasma interaction as the driving pulse, which subsequently interacts with a thin target to produce an attosecond electron bunch. Using this method, we successfully generated an electron bunch characterized by excellent collimation and an ultra-short duration of approximately 100 attoseconds, representing a substantial reduction in bunch duration. The total bunch charge achieved was 0.38 nC, with an emittance of $4.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{mm} \\cdot \\text{mrad}$ and a divergence angle of approximately $10^\\circ$. Moreover, by systematically analyzing the effects of laser intensity and target positioning, we determined an optimized set of simulation parameters. This research establishes a robust foundation for the generation of ultrashort electron bunches and opens new prospects for their application in advanced high-energy and attosecond physics experiments.",

    "abstract": "Using particle-in-cell simulations that label ions and electrons according to their initial inflow region, we find that during 2D collisionless magnetic reconnection, the bulk flow of the plasma from each inflow side crosses paths with plasma from the other inflow side and crosses the midplane before being redirected into an outflow jet. This feature, which we term ``flow crossover,'' implies mechanisms to generate bulk motion in a direction parallel to the magnetic field. We find that ions and electrons undergo different parallel driving mechanisms, leading to different flow crossover patterns. The parallel bulk flow for ions is generated more locally within the ion diffusion region, whereas the parallel bulk flow for electrons is mostly generated outside the electron diffusion region. Consequently, the reconnection outflows are more of a parallel flow than a perpendicular flow, especially for the electron outflow. The flow crossover and the parallel outflow patterns occur not only in symmetric reconnection but also in the more complex scenario of a guide-field asymmetric reconnection, suggesting that it is a general feature of collisionless magnetic reconnection. Because the plasma on one side of the outflow mostly originates from the inflow plasma on the other side, we predict that near an asymmetric reconnection site in a collisionless space plasma, in situ observations across the outflow region could reveal locally reversed gradients in plasma properties.",

We derive the dispersion relation for the corresponding mathematical description, a reduced Vlasov--Maxwell system, by extending the well-known Penrose condition. It is observed that, under very mild assumptions, the dispersion relation decouples into two parts. The first part is identical to the classic Penrose condition for the Vlasov--Poisson system, while the second part describes the influence of the laser on the transverse dynamics (e.g. a Weibel instability). In particular, this means that the longitudinal dynamics (e.g. a two-stream instability) can not be stabilized in this manner as far as linear theory is concerned. We show, however, that nonlinear effects can be used to couple the two parts and achieve effective control. This is done by determining the control parameters (i.e. the form of the external electric and magnetic fields) by solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem.",

    "abstract": "Pedestal Relaxation Events (PREs) appear in I-mode discharges close to the I-H transition. Although they show certain similarities with Edge Localised Modes (ELMs), i.e. periodic energy ejections, the underlying mechanism seems to be very different from the mechanism responsible for ELMs. In this manuscript, we present global trans-collisional fluid simulations of an I-mode discharge in ASDEX Upgrade using GRILLIX. We observe multiple PREs during the simulation, which reproduce a range of experimentally observed PRE characteristics. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of various mode properties in our simulation allows us to pinpoint the underlying mechanism responsible for triggering PREs to Micro-Tearing Modes (MTMs). The system is analysed dynamically by evaluating density and electron temperature gradient lengths at the OMP position, where the MTM is located and grows over time. The path taken by the system in gradient length space is compared to a growth-rate estimate calculated by linear theory in simplified slab geometry, providing excellent agreement. Building on these insights, we sketch a qualitative picture of a full PRE cycle. Finally, we discuss the influence of the recently implemented Landau-fluid closure and the challenges of simulating low collisionality regimes with trans-collisional fluid models, like the one employed by GRILLIX.",

    "abstract": "To simulate plasma phenomena, large-scale computational resources have been employed in developing high-precision and high-resolution plasma simulations. One of the main obstacles in plasma simulations is the requirement of computational resources that scale polynomially with the number of spatial grids, which poses a significant challenge for large-scale modeling. To address this issue, this study presents a quantum algorithm for simulating the nonlinear electromagnetic fluid dynamics that govern space plasmas. We map it, by applying Koopman-von Neumann linearization, to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and evolve the system using Hamiltonian simulation via quantum singular value transformation. Our algorithm scales $O \\left(s N_x \\, \\mathrm{polylog} \\left( N_x \\right) T \\right)$ in time complexity with $s$, $N_x$, and $T$ being the spatial dimension, the number of spatial grid points per dimension, and the evolution time, respectively. Comparing the scaling $O \\left( s N_x^s \\left(T^{5/4}+T N_x\\right) \\right)$ for the classical method with the finite volume scheme, this algorithm achieves polynomial speedup in $N_x$. The space complexity of this algorithm is exponentially reduced from $O\\left( s N_x^s \\right)$ to $O\\left( s \\, \\mathrm{polylog} \\left( N_x \\right) \\right)$. Numerical experiments validate that accurate solutions are attainable with smaller $m$ than theoretically anticipated and with practical values of $m$ and $R$, underscoring the feasibility of the approach. As a practical demonstration, the method accurately reproduces the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, underscoring its capability to tackle more intricate nonlinear dynamics. These results suggest that quantum computing can offer a viable pathway to overcome the computational barriers of multiscale plasma modeling.",

The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling, which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale.

In this article, we explore possible strategies to control and optimize the resulting electron beams using laser and gas parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that in near-critical plasmas, linearly and circularly polarized pulses are more efficient than radially polarized pulses for electron acceleration. In addition, electron beams obtained from linearly polarized pulses have lower divergence angles. By studying the efficiency of the acceleration process - characterized by the maximum kinetic energy of electrons and their total number - we identify optimal conditions in ambient air at wavelength lambda_0 approximately 1.5 micrometers and a_0 >= 15. We also scale our results to lower-density air and demonstrate that some noble gases (Ne, Ar) are suitable media for accelerating electrons. Our investigations show that this acceleration scheme enables multi-MeV electrons with low divergence using millijoule-class high-repetition rate lasers, making it a promising candidate for applications in medical sciences and ultrafast imaging.",

With this paper we introduce a modeling alternative for linear waves in plasmas described by another non-equilibrium model, namely the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution. This can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons associated with the Earth's bow shock and interplanetary shocks or of electrons in the solar transition region. We derive the corresponding dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in terms of the newly introduced Druyvsteyn dispersion function, numerically compute, for the isotropic case, the dispersion curves as well as damping rates, and provide analytical approximation in the limit of weak damping. Thereby, we provide a new modeling tool that facilitates the quantitative treatment of a variety of non-Maxwellian plasmas.",

    "abstract": "We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.",

    "abstract": "In \"arXiv:2312.13429\" Lackner et al. use standard methods to decide if it is possible to ignite mixed fuels. They correctly identify that the increased radiation losses make ignition significantly more challenging than for pure DT fuels, since this leads to higher ignition temperatures. Further, they conclude that at those temperatures the reduced electronic $\\alpha$-stopping makes ignition impossible. We show that this conclusion is not correct. The model used for $\\alpha$-stopping by Lackner et al. is only approximately correct for low temperatures and hydrogen isotopes. By extending the $\\alpha$-stopping model to include ionic $\\alpha$-stopping we show in \\cite{ruhlkornarXiv5} that the contribution of ionic $\\alpha$-particle stopping cannot be neglected. The ionic $\\alpha$-stopping together with the neutron stopping, which is also neglected by Lackner et al., lead to elevated ion temperatures implying $kT_i > kT_e$. Those three effects combined lead us to the conclusion, that ignition of mixed fuels is indeed possible with far reaching implications, contrary to the analysis by Lackner.",

By injecting a weak, coherent seed electromagnetic (EM) field into the axion-photon conversion region, the axion-induced EM field can constructively interfere with the seed field, amplifying the number of regenerated photons to a level exceeding that of the unseeded scenario. We evaluate the expected signal enhancement, statistical limits from Poisson counting with seed fluctuations and background, and the potential improvement in coupling sensitivity. Compared to a standard LSW setup, the seeded scheme can achieve orders-of-magnitude higher photon yield per axion, potentially surpassing resonance-enhanced experiments in certain parameter regimes. This approach presents a promising pathway to extend the reach of laboratory axion searches, particularly in scenarios where the resonant cavities are impractical.",

We analyze Parker Solar Probe observations to understand the collisionless heating of the sub-Alfv\\'enic solar wind, which is connected to the solar corona. Our results show that linear resonant heating through parallel-propagating cyclotron waves cannot account for turbulent dissipation in sub-Alfv\\'enic region, which observations suggest may dissipate turbulence at distances further from the Sun. Instead, we find that stochastic heating can account for the observed ion energization; however, because the dominant contributions arise from infrequent, large-amplitude events, turbulent intermittency must be explicitly incorporated. These observations directly connect stochastic heating via breaking of the proton magnetic moment with the intermittent and inhomogeneous heating of turbulence reported in many previous studies. Our identification of stochastic heating as a dynamic mechanism responsible for intermittent heating of the solar wind has significant implications for turbulent dissipation in the lower corona, other astrophysical environments, and laboratory plasma.",

Mild initial thermal spread restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses.

The simulation models the generation of nanoflares and response of the plasma to imposed photospheric motions. Our study focuses on characterizing the energy distribution and occurrence frequency of the nanoflares in the simulation that self-consistently heat the corona. This field line based analysis reveals that the nanoflare energy distribution (energy per unit cross sectional area) follows a log-normal profile, where low energy nanoflares are significantly more prevalent than those with high energy. When compared with the plasma cooling time, different energy nanoflares tend to repeat with different frequencies. Low energy nanoflares repeat at high frequencies, while high energy nanoflares repeat at low frequencies. However, the thermal evolution of plasma along individual field lines is governed predominantly by the high energy nanoflares. These findings provide critical insights into the role of small-scale magnetic reconnection events in heating the solar corona.",

Such relativistic electron beams could generate extreme volumetric power densities inside the FW armour which lead to significant vaporization, deep melting and even material explosions, as well as to elevated temperatures at the bond interface with the cooling substrate that could cause rupture and water leaks. Here the thermal response of the ITER FW is modeled with a three-stage, one-way coupled workflow focusing on assessments of the extent of the wall damage and the increase of the bond interface temperature for varying W thickness. Increased W thickness is found to be essential for wall protection against intense RE dissipation events in terms of both W tile damage and cooling system integrity.",

Recent observational evidence highlights that fast-mode interplanetary shock waves have positive residual energy, in sharp contrast to the negative residual energy of the turbulence and magnetic structures that constitute the vast majority of fluctuation power in the solar wind at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) inertial scales. In this work, we apply the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to derive an equation for the residual energy of an MHD shock jump as a function of the shock angle, density compression ratio and Alfv\\'en Mach number upstream of the shock. An equation for the cross helicity is similarly derived. The residual energy equation gives only positive values for super-Alfv\\'enic (i.e. fast-mode) shocks. The residual energy and cross helicity of slow-mode shocks and tangential, contact and rotational discontinuities are also determined. A simplified form of the residual energy equation applicable to perpendicular shocks has been verified against residual energy values directly estimated from observations of 141 interplanetary shocks; the equation is found to match well with observations, particularly for shocks with higher density compression ratios and Mach numbers. The use of positive residual energy as a signature for fast-mode shock identification in spacecraft data is briefly considered, and insights from this work relating to compressive fluctuations more generally in the solar wind are discussed.",

Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.

In this work, we investigate the development of anisotropic momentum distributions induced by the combined action of electric and magnetic fields on a thermally relativistic plasma. We consider three distinct types of anisotropy. The first arises from a pure magnetic field acting on plasma with either isotropic or anisotropic initial momentum distributions, producing the characteristic ring-shaped momentum profile. The second is driven by a pure electric field, where radiation reaction generates a partial, anisotropic ring distribution in momentum space: significant modifications occur primarily in the 90$^\\circ$--180$^\\circ$ and 270$^\\circ$--360$^\\circ$ sectors of the $p_x$--$p_y$ plane, while the remaining quadrants remain largely unaffected. The third case considers the combined effect of electric and magnetic fields. When the cyclotron frequency is very close to the upper hybrid frequency, the azimuthal symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution is broken. Conversely, in the regime where the cyclotron frequency is lower than the upper hybrid frequency, the rapid oscillations of the electric field dominate and preserve the symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution.",

We solve the 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a bespoke numerical boundary condition (a sponge region) that damps wave reflections and thus allows the long-term periodic signal at the 3D null point to be investigated. We observe multiple cycles of the 3D oscillatory reconnection mechanism for the first time. We find that the periodicity is both constant and independent of the choice of driving amplitude. Furthermore, the resultant time-dependent current density at the null point normalized by the driving amplitude is invariant. We extract a single period for oscillatory reconnection at a 3D null point, opening the future possibility of using this characteristic period as a diagnostic tool to reveal indirectly the fundamental plasma properties of 3D null points.",

    "abstract": "Recent Parker Solar Probe measurements have revealed that solar wind (SW) turbulence transits from a subsonic to a transonic regime near the Sun, while remaining sub-Alfv\\'enic. These observations call for a revision of existing SW models, where turbulence is considered to be both subsonic and sub-Alfv\\'enic. In this Letter, we introduce a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of Transonic sub-Alfv\\'enic Turbulence (TsAT). Our model shows that turbulence is effectively nearly-incompressible (NI) and has a 2D + slab geometry not only in the subsonic limit, but also in the transonic regime, as long as it remains sub-Alfv\\'enic, a condition essentially enforced everywhere in the heliosphere by the strong local magnetic field. These predictions are consistent with 3D MHD simulations, showing that transonic turbulence is dominated by low frequency quasi-2D incompressible structures, while compressible fluctuations are a minor component corresponding to low frequency slow modes and high frequency fast modes. Our new TsAT model extends existing NI theories of turbulence, and is potentially relevant for the theoretical and numerical modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Sun SW, the solar corona, and the interstellar medium.",

    "title": "A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in EMC3",
    "abstract": "One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \\varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.",

Due to the large kinetic energies of the ejected dust particles, their subsequent mechanical impacts on the vessel lead to extensive cratering. Earlier experimental studies of high velocity micrometric tungsten dust collisions with tungsten plates focused exclusively on normal impacts. Here, oblique high velocity tungsten-on-tungsten mechanical impacts are reproduced in a controlled manner by a two-stage light gas gun shooting system. The strong dependence of the crater characteristics and crater morphology on the incident angle is documented. A reliable empirical damage law is extracted for the dependence of the crater depth on the incident angle.",

We report the first observation of intermittent viscoelastic turbulence in such plasmas using large-scale three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations. In driven dissipative SCP, we observe scale-dependent flow dynamics arising from the interplay between potential (elastic) and viscous dissipation at the particle level. Unlike conventional turbulence, governed by inertia and viscosity, SCP exhibits distinct energy transfer processes due to its intrinsic viscoelasticity. Both kinetic and elastic energy spectra show power-law scaling $E(k), \\Phi(k) \\propto k^{-3.5}$. In real space, velocity structure functions display nontrivial scaling, and the probability distribution functions of velocity increments deviate significantly from Gaussian behavior, especially in the tails, signatures of intermittency. These findings establish SCP as a novel platform for studying viscoelastic turbulence, with broad relevance to astrophysical plasmas, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.",

    "abstract": "The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$ $\\rho$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$ $k_{\\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\\sim35^{\\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).",

    "abstract": "Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality, and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new \"windmill\" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection. We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are suitable for coupling LPA stages.",

    "abstract": "Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\\alpha \\approx -\\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\\alpha \\approx -2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \\approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic) energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and discuss the astrophysical implications of this theoretical work.",

    "abstract": "Context. In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.",

    "abstract": "Plasma turbulence cascading from MHD to kinetic scales in the heliospheric plasma is believed to play a key role in coronal heating and fast solar wind acceleration, but the properties of the turbulence remain poorly constrained by observations. Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfv\\'en waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\\sim 0.1$~R$_\\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\\sim 1$~au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\\sim 10$~R$_\\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available. The results provide unique diagnostics of the ion-scale plasma turbulence amplitude and energy cascade rate spanning over three orders of magnitude in solar distance.",

This mechanism is derived from a 2D axisymmetric fluid model, which has limitations in describing multiple streamer events in real-world 3D scenarios. To validate the Following Streamer mechanism, we experimentally investigate the discharge morphology of SF6 streamers induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative pulsed voltage. The results are then compared with those from 2D axisymmetric fluid simulations. The comparison reveals both consistencies and discrepancies. Regarding consistencies, experimentally observed features-such as streamer inception at both ends of the metal particle and the formation of subsequent following streamers-support the general idea of the Following Streamer mechanism. Regarding discrepancies, the experiments show a larger number of following streamers and off-axis propagation paths, which cannot be described in the 2D simulation. For scientific rigor, an extended physical model was proposed to improve the description of the Following Streamer mechanism.",

The intake device plays a crucial role in capturing and supplying propellant, and its capture efficiency is a key indicator of drag-compensation feasibility. For experimental evaluation, an electric-propulsion (EP) plasma plume can be used as a particle-flow generator to simulate the VLEO atmosphere in ground facilities. This study numerically investigates the interaction of an EP plasma plume with an intake device to establish guidelines for measuring capture efficiency in conventional vacuum facilities. A hybrid PIC-DSMC method with ion-surface interaction models is employed to simulate the plasma plume incident on the intake. The composition of the captured flow is governed by beam-ion energy and species mass: lowering the energy and using lighter atmospheric constituents increase plume divergence and promote neutralization, yielding a neutral-dominated outlet flow. Sputtering of the intake surface becomes non-negligible at high energies but can be mitigated by operating at appropriately low beam energies. The results show that simultaneous ion and neutral diagnostics are required for reliable capture-efficiency evaluation when using EP plasma plumes in ground facilities.",

In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics.",

A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $\\beta$.

    "abstract": "The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\\rho_e$ scales.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between magnetic flux ropes and magnetic reconnection is fundamental to both space and astrophysical plasma studies. In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are <20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by <10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.",

    "abstract": "Phase mixing is a fundamental kinetic process that governs dissipation and stability in collisionless plasmas, but its inherent filamentation in velocity space creates major challenges for both high-fidelity simulations and reduced-order modeling. This work presents the first exploratory evaluation of a joint Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (POD-SINDy) framework applied to particle-in-cell simulations of phase mixing. Simulation datasets were generated under progressively complex conditions, starting from a passive kinetic case without self-consistent electric fields, extending to self-consistent simulations with nonlinear electric field feedback, and finally to a noisy dataset with reduced particle resolution. In the passive kinetic regime, POD-SINDy achieved near-optimal reconstructions with only five modes, reproducing filamentation with errors below four percent. In self-consistent electrostatic cases, variance spread across more modes due to nonlinear interactions and noise, slowing singular value decay and making strict low-rank embeddings more demanding. Nevertheless, retaining ten modes was sufficient to recover the dominant structures, yielding reconstruction errors of about seven percent for the low-noise case and thirteen percent for the noisy dataset. Across all scenarios, SINDy provided sparse and interpretable equations for modal amplitudes that remained predominantly linear despite the underlying nonlinear data, while POD truncation effectively filtered particle noise and preserved coherent dynamics. These findings demonstrate that POD-SINDy constitutes a compact and interpretable approach to reduced-order modeling of phase mixing, capable of retaining essential physics across regimes of increasing complexity while achieving data compression from three to five orders of magnitude depending on dataset complexity.",

We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\\geq 90^\\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.",

    "abstract": "Stellarator boundary optimization faces a fundamental numerical challenge: the extreme disparity between low- and high-mode amplitudes creates an optimization landscape in which direct full-spectrum approaches typically converge to poor local minima. Traditionally, this challenge has been addressed through a computationally expensive, multi-step Fourier continuation, in which low Fourier modes are optimized first, followed by the gradual incorporation of higher modes. We present Exponential Spectral Scaling (ESS), a technique that applies a mode-dependent exponential scaling factor to each Fourier mode. Our primary implementation uses the $L_{\\infty}$ norm to determine the scaling pattern, creating a square spectral decay profile that effectively reduces the dynamic range of optimization variables from $10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ to $10^{2}$--$10^{3}$. This scaling aligns with the natural spectral decay of physically meaningful configurations and enables direct single-step optimization using the full spectrum of boundary Fourier modes. ESS eliminates arbitrary staging decisions and reduces computation time by a factor of $2$ to $5$ in benchmark cases. In addition to accelerating optimization, ESS improves robustness, reducing sensitivity to initial conditions and increasing confidence in avoiding local optima. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESS across both quasi-axisymmetric (QA) and quasi-helically symmetric (QH) configurations, using two distinct optimization toolkits: SIMSOPT and DESC.",

    "abstract": "With the recent inception of intense pulsed THz sources via optical rectification using crystalline lithium niobate, non-perturbative measurements of the internal local magnetic field are now possible using Pulsed Polarimetry on any magnetic fusion device. Pulsed Polarimetry resolves the sightline magnetic field and density, analogous to RADAR measurements of the spatial distribution of precipitation. With a suitable sightline, the FRC midplane density and axial field profiles can be determined with the azimuthal current density given by Ampere's law. Pulsed Polarimetry can be enhanced to measure the sightline distributed electron temperature by adding spectroscopy. A THz Pulsed Spectropolarimeter using a heterodyne receiver is appropriate if collective Thomson backscatter is induced. In this case, electronic filtering provides spatial distributions of the ion spectral density function. The sightline bulk ion temperature as well as confined fast ion velocity distributions can be measured which is of particular importance to plasmas that are heated and sustained by NBI. The ability to steer the sightline without loss of alignment distinguishes this diagnostic from crossbeam diagnostics. The term, diagnostic agility denotes a diagnostic's ability to provide both temporal and spatial real-time feedback on demand across the poloidal plane analogous to 2D imaging Doppler RADAR. THz Pulsed Spectropolarimetry is extensively detailed along with simulated measurements on an FRC equilibrium. Comparisons are made with long pulse CTS crossbeam diagnostics. The role this technique can play within the wider MFE program towards future fusion reactors as an advanced diagnostic is explored. The nature and breadth of the measurements fulfills the mission of future diagnostics to maintain and optimize fusion reactor performance.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.",

Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.",

In reactor-scale stellarators, more dangerous runaway generation may occur both between discharges and during low-density plasma operation. Since a radiation-induced seed population is necessarily present in an activated device, an accidental coil ramp-down could convert substantial magnetic energy into wall-damaging runaway currents.

    "abstract": "We address three two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics models: reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), Hazeltine's model, and the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) equation. These models are derived to capture the basic features of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and plasma behaviour. They all possess non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations in terms of Lie-Poisson brackets, which imply an infinite number of conservation laws along with symplecticity of the phase flow. This geometric structure in phase space affects the statistical long-time behaviour. Therefore, to capture the qualitative features in long-time numerical simulations, it is critical to use a discretization that preserves the rich phase space geometry. Here, we use the matrix hydrodynamics approach to achieve structure-preserving discretizations for each model. We furthermore carry out long-time simulations with randomized initial data and a comparison between the models. The study shows consistent behaviour for the magnetic potential: both RMHD and Hazeltine's model produce magnetic dipoles (in CHM, the magnetic potential is prescribed). These results suggest an inverse cascade of magnetic energy and of the mean-square magnetic potential, which is empirically verified via spectral scaling diagrams. On the other hand, the vorticity field dynamics differs between the models: RMHD forms sharp vortex filaments with rapidly growing vorticity values, whereas Hazeltine's model and CHM show only small variation in the vorticity values. Related to this observation, both Hazeltine's model and CHM give spectral scaling diagrams indicating an inverse cascade of kinetic energy not present in RMHD.",

    "abstract": "We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.",

    "abstract": "The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a L\\'evy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.",

    "abstract": "A method is proposed to generate coherent, intense zeptosecond x-ray pulses by using the electron beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) stage as the driver for a beam driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) stage. The LWFA injector stage requires a readily available 100 TW laser driver to produce a GeV class self-injected electron beam. This beam is focused and used as the driver in a PWFA stage that utilizes a solid-density plasma with a modulated density downramp. The concept is shown to be capable of producing an ultra-short electron beam with unprecedented density ($10^{26}~\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) and brightness ($ 10^{24}~\\ampere/\\meter^2/\\radian ^2$), that is also pre-bunched on 0.1 Angstrom scales. By colliding this pre-bunched extreme beam with an optical undulator, an intense zeptosecond pulse can be emitted if the spatially focusing region is matched with the lasing region of the beam. Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed of the entire concept to demonstrate that an isolated 10 GW-class zeptosecond pulse with a full-width-half-maximum duration of 700 zs can be generated in a tapered laser pulse. Such an intense zeptosecond pulse generation scheme may provide an essential probe for nuclear physics and quantum electrodynamics processes.",

    "abstract": "We investigate how time dependent modulations of drift wave amplitudes affect particle transport and chaos in a magnetized plasma. Using the Horton model, we apply a sawtooth ramp to a primary wave's amplitude and periodic rectangular kicks to secondary waves, simulating a driven system. Particle transport is quantified by the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) exponent, $\\alpha$, and chaos by the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE). Our primary finding is a strong negative correlation between the system's average chaoticity and its transport efficiency. We show that rapid sawtooth ramping (short period $\\tau$) produces highly efficient, superdiffusive transport ($\\alpha > 1$). In contrast, slower ramping increases the system's chaos but suppresses transport, driving it towards normal diffusion ($\\alpha \\to 1$). This counter intuitive result demonstrates that heightened chaos destroys the coherent, streamer like structures necessary for superdiffusive flights. Our findings indicate that the coherence of the turbulent field, rather than its raw chaoticity, is the key determinant of transport efficiency, offering a new perspective on plasma control.",

    "abstract": "Resonant interactions between high energy runaway electrons (REs) and whistler waves are a promising mechanism for RE mitigation in tokamak plasmas. While prior studies have largely relied on quasi-linear diffusion models in simplified geometries, we present a first-principles-informed framework that models RE-whistler interactions in a 3D tokamak equilibrium. This is achieved by coupling AORSA, which computes whistler eigenmodes for a given tokamak plasma equilibrium, and KORC, a kinetic orbit code that tracks full orbit RE trajectories in prescribed wave fields. Our results demonstrate that REs undergo scattering to large pitch angles and exhibit anomalous diffusion in both pitch-angle and kinetic energy space. Crucially, we observe a transition between diffusive, sub-diffusive, and super-diffusive transport regimes as a function of initial RE energy - an effect not captured by existing quasi-linear models. This anomalous transport behavior represents a significant advancement in understanding RE dynamics in the presence of wave - particle interactions. By identifying the conditions under which anomalous diffusion arises, this work lays the theoretical foundation for designing targeted, wave-based mitigation strategies in future tokamak experiments.",

This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.",

The complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model, fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy, demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface, reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for future fusion reactors.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a large database validation of the Gyro Fluid System (GFS) model for linear gyrokinetic stability for high-mode (H-mode) edge transport barrier conditions in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) tokamak. The database of linear stability calculations with the CGYRO gyrokinetic code was produced using plasma profile measurements from NSTX discharges to identify kinetic ballooning modes (KBM), trapped electron modes (TEM), and micro-tearing modes (MTM) that limit the pressure profile gradient in the H-mode barrier. A novel Bayesian optimization approach determines optimal resolution parameters for GFS specifically for spherical tokamak pedestal conditions. Our results demonstrate that GFS, with optimized resolution, can achieve accurate linear stability analysis in NSTX pedestal conditions for reduced resolution compared to CGYRO. GFS can accurately find the KBM, TEM, and MTM instability branches. Parametric analysis reveals that GFS accuracy in this extreme pedestal parameter range is degraded for low magnetic shear and near the separatrix conditions. These findings establish GFS as a fast linear eigenmode solver for spherical tokamak pedestal gyrokinetic stability and demonstrate a systematic methodology for determining the optimum resolution settings.",

This phenomenon occurs as a planar shock wavefront encounters a compressible obstacle in the form of a void whose size is larger than the wavelength of the wave. As they collide, the central portion of the wavefront, that is the first to touch the void, is blocked while the rest of the front continues to propagate, resulting in an inward bending of the shock wave. The bent shock wave eventually collapses, leading to the transient trapping of dust particles in the void. Subsequently, a Coulomb explosion of the trapped particles generates a bow shock. The experiments have been carried out in a DC glow discharge plasma, where the shock wave and the void are simultaneously created as self-excited modes of a three-dimensional dust cloud. The salient features of this phenomenon are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations, which provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of this interaction.",

GISAXS resolves ultrafast changes in surface nanomorphology (correlation length, roughness), while GID quantifies subsurface lattice compression, grain orientation, melting, and recrystallization. The approach overcomes photon-flux limitations of synchrotron grazing-incidence geometries and provides stringent, time-resolved benchmarks for complex theoretical models of ultrafast laser-matter interaction and warm dense matter.

    "abstract": "Elliptic equations play a crucial role in turbulence models for magnetic confinement fusion. Regardless of the chosen modeling approach - whether gyrokinetic, gyrofluid, or drift-fluid - the Poisson equation and Amp\\`{e}re's law lead to elliptic problems that must be solved on 2D planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. In this work, we present an efficient solver for such generalised elliptic problems, especially suited for the conditions in the boundary region. A finite difference discretisation is employed, and the solver is based on a flexible generalised minimal residual method (fGMRES) with a geometric multigrid preconditioner. We present implementations with OpenMP parallelisation and GPU acceleration, with backends in CUDA and HIP. On the node level, significant speed-ups are achieved with the GPU implementation, exceeding external library solutions such as rocALUTION. In accordance with theoretical scaling laws for multigrid methods, we observe linear scaling of the solver with problem size, $O(N)$. This solver is implemented in the PARALLAX/PAccX libraries and serves as a central component of the plasma boundary turbulence codes GRILLIX and GENE-X.",

    "title": "Helical Core Formation and MHD Stability in ITER-Scale Plasmas with Fusion-born Alpha Particles",
    "abstract": "The effect of fusion-born alpha particles on the helical core (HC), a long-lived ideal saturation state of the $m/n=1/1$ kink/quasi-interchange mode, is studied in the ITER-scale hybrid scenario where a core plasma has a low magnetic shear $q\\gtrsim1$. The HC state is determined by 3-D MHD force balance and all factors that contribute to it, such as plasma shaping, the safety factor profile, and the pressure profiles of all particle species. An incomplete but useful measure of the HC is the displacement of the magnetic axis, $\\delta_\\mathrm{HC}$. Using MHD-PIC simulations, we find that $\\delta_\\mathrm{HC}$ is enhanced by increasing alpha particle pressure $\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}$. Within the ITER operating alpha pressure $\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}(0) \\lesssim 1\\%$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ can be approximately treated as part of the total MHD pressure. In this regime, there is no notable flattening of the pressure profile, indicating that the HC preserves the omnigenity of the plasma. If one increases $\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}(0)$ beyond $1\\%$, $\\delta_\\mathrm{HC}$ continues to increase with $\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ until it reaches an upper limit at $\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}(0)=3\\%$ for our reference case. At this limit, both the bulk and alpha pressure profiles are partially flattened, indicating a reduction in omnigenity. After HC formation, a resistive pressure-driven MHD mode can become unstable, which is localized along the compressed magnetic flux region of the HC. This secondary mode consists of a broad spectrum of short-wavelength Fourier components that grow at same rates and are thus part of a single coherent entity. Our present simulation model is insufficient to adequately represent such a secondary mode; however, preliminary results suggest that it can facilitate magnetic chaos, which affects plasma confinement.",

    "title": "A Wendelstein-7X Profile Database for Informed Transport Studies",
    "abstract": "To advance the development of future fusion devices beyond Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), a robust understanding of energy confinement time scaling is crucial. Universal temperature and density profile shapes are theoretically anticipated through a comparison of the empirical ISS04 confinement time scaling with predictions based on Gyro-Bohm heat flux scaling. This thesis investigates the presence of these universalities in W7-X experimental profiles and subsequently tests existing confinement time scalings against this data.   Experimental profiles are obtained from Thomson scattering diagnostics. Gradient length scales, defined as the radial derivative of the logarithmic quantity of the investigated profiles, are extracted from these profiles through fitting procedures. These scales serve as boundary conditions for subsequent gyrokinetic flux-tube simulations using the GX code. The simulated heat fluxes are then employed to reconstruct profiles by solving the power balance equation and density evolution.   A comparison of these reconstructed profiles with the averaged experimental profiles reveals that the predicted density profiles are steeper than those measured in the reference dataset. To investigate this discrepancy, additional discharges exhibiting more peaked density profiles, including both high-performance and low-power plasmas, are examined. Furthermore, the ratio of experimental temperature and density scale lengths is incorporated as an input into the simulations, and the resulting simulated heat fluxes are evaluated.   Discrepancies between the simulated and measured profiles are discussed, with potential explanations encompassing particle sources and neoclassical transport mechanisms. This comprehensive approach aims to deepen our understanding of the critical role of profile shape and transport mechanisms in plasma confinement.",

    "abstract": "Developing physically consistent closure models is a longstanding challenge in simulating plasma turbulence, even in minimal systems such as the two-field Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) model, which captures essential features of drift-wave turbulence with a reduced set of variables. In this work, we leverage theoretical insights from Direct Interaction Approximation (DIA) to construct a six-term closure structure that captures the dominant turbulent transport processes, including both diffusion and hyper-diffusion. While the mathematical form of the closure is fully prescribed by DIA, the corresponding transport coefficients are learned from data using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The resulting Extended HW model with Closure (EHW-C) model reveals several nontrivial features of plasma turbulence: notably, some inferred coefficients become negative in certain regimes, indicating inverse transport, a phenomenon absent in conventional closure models. Moreover, the EHW-C model accurately reproduces the spectral and flux characteristics of high-resolution Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), while requiring only one-eighth the spatial resolution per direction, yielding a tenfold speed-up. This work demonstrates how theory-guided machine learning can both enhance computational efficiency and uncover emergent transport mechanisms in strongly nonlinear plasma systems.",

    "title": "The impact of kinetic and global effects on ballooning 2nd stable pedestals of conventional and low aspect ratio tokamaks",
    "abstract": "The EPED model [P.B. Snyder et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 103016] had success describing the pedestals of the Type-I ELM and QH-mode operations in conventional tokamaks, by combining kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) and peeling-ballooning (PB) constraints. Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the ideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that quantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK) ballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals are consistent with observations in initial studies on conventional and spherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the calculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on a novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al 2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as well as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening a route integrating this model into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit the access to the local 2nd stability and thus provide a transport mechanism that constrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning stability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown that nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the critical beta_p,ped when a 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of GFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided an improved agreement in comparison to EPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.",

    "title": "Role of magnetic shear distribution on the formation of eruptive flux ropes",
    "abstract": "Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.",

    "abstract": "The fermion sign problem constitutes a fundamental computational bottleneck across a plethora of research fields in physics, quantum chemistry and related disciplines. Recently, it has been suggested to alleviate the sign problem in \\emph{ab initio} path integral Molecular Dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculations based on the simulation of fictitious identical particles that are represented by a continuous quantum statistics variable $\\xi$ [\\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This idea facilitated a host of applications including the interpretation of an x-ray scattering experiment with strongly compressed beryllium at the National Ignition Facility [\\textit{Nature Commun.}~\\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. In the present work, we express the original isothermal $\\xi$-extrapolation method as a special case of a truncated Taylor series expansion around the $\\xi=0$ limit of distinguishable particles. We derive new PIMC estimators that allow us to evaluate the Taylor coefficients up to arbitrary order and we carry out extensive new PIMC simulations of the warm dense electron gas to systematically analyze the sign problem from this new perspective. This gives us important insights into the applicability of the $\\xi$-extrapolation method for different levels of quantum degeneracy in terms of the Taylor series radius of convergence. Moreover, the direct PIMC evaluation of the $\\xi$-derivatives, in principle, removes the necessity for simulations at different values of $\\xi$ and can facilitate more efficient simulations that are designed to maximize compute time in those regions of the full permutation space that contribute most to the final Taylor estimate of the fermionic expectation value of interest.",

Admixtures of ozone and the halocarbon CHClF2 (R22, chlorodifluoromethane) to atmospheric gases (N2, O2, Ar) were exposed to a glow discharge in the total pressure regime of a few hPa. According to the mass spectrometric analysis of the gas composition the discharge initiates significant ozone depletion by a factor four in the absence of R22. This depletion is strongly enhanced to two orders of magnitude in the presence of R22. The possible underlying reactions are discussed.",

We demonstrate the computational advantage of the relativistic semi-implicit method (RelSIM), which allows for reduced resolution while avoiding the numerical instabilities typically affecting standard explicit methods, helping to bridge the gap between macroscopic and kinetic scales. Two- and three-dimensional semi-implicit particle-in-cell simulations explore the linear tearing instability and the nonlinear development of reconnection and subsequent particle acceleration starting from a relativistic Harris equilibrium with no guide field. The simulations show that particle acceleration in the context of magnetic reconnection leads to energetic power-law spectra with cutoff energies, consistent with previous work done using explicit methods, but are obtained with a considerably reduced resolution.",

    "abstract": "Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau.

By probing plasmon dispersion across momentum transfers $k$ = 0.99-2.57 Angstrom$^{-1}$ with high statistical fidelity, we directly test competing theories of electron dynamics under extreme conditions. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) reproduces both the observed plasmon energies and spectral shapes across the full $k$ range, whereas the random phase approximation (RPA) and static local-field-correction (LFC) models systematically overestimate the plasmon frequency, even for aluminium (a canonical uniform electron gas metal). Considering electron localisation around ions and the loss of crystalline symmetry due to liquid-state disorder, our measurements provide direct evidence that simple uniform electron gas models fail in warm dense matter and establish TDDFT as a reliable approach for electronic correlations in this regime.",

    "abstract": "A theory of a new magnetodynamic effect describing the energy exchange between the degrees of freedom of a conducting cylinder moving in a helical magnetic field has been developed. The possibility of effectively converting the translational motion of the cylinder into its angular rotation around the system axis (translational-rotational conversion, TRC) has been demonstrated. A connection between this effect and the formation of helical trajectories of electrons in undulators in free electron lasers (FELs) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) has been revealed. In TRC, unlike many known effects associated with the interaction of a moving conductor with a magnetic field, the conductor has no electrical contact with any external circuit, which makes it especially attractive for various applications. The TRC is also possible in a magnetohydrodynamic flow moving along the axis of a helical magnetic field. The theory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, which corresponds to a sufficiently fast motion of well-conducting objects. In this scenario, the dynamics of the system is described by a nonlinear pendulum equation or a nonlinear pendulum equation with a nonzero right-hand side. In the latter case, a system dynamic mode corresponding to phase lock can be implemented.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of initial vorticity packing fractions on the transport properties of decaying incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions. Turbulence is initiated via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and evolves through nonlinear inverse energy cascades, forming large-scale coherent structures that dominate the flow over long eddy turnover times. The initial vorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively distinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors. Tracer particle trajectories are computed in the fluid field obtained using the Eulerian framework, with transport and mixing quantified using statistical measures such as absolute dispersion, position probability distribution functions (PDFs), and velocity PDFs. In the early stages, the onset of turbulence is primarily governed by the instability growth rate, which increases with vorticity packing fraction. As the flow evolves, transport exhibits a range of behaviors-subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive-and transitions between anisotropic and isotropic regimes, depending on the initial vorticity packing, flow structure, and stage of evolution. At later times, transport is dominated by the motion of large-scale coherent vortices, whose dynamics are also influenced by the initial vorticity packing ranging from subdiffusive trapping rotational motion and random walks, and L\\'evy flight-like events. These findings offer insights into transport in quasi-2D systems-ranging from laboratory-scale flows to geophysical phenomena and astrophysical structures-through analogies with 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.",

    "abstract": "During solar storms, the polar cusp often exhibits electron populations with distinct velocity distributions, which may be associated with the two-stream instability. This study reveals the evolution of the two-stream instability associated with electron velocities and the interaction between the growth phase of the two-stream instability and the electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs). The results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are compared with satellite observational data and computational outcomes. The potential risks associated with two-stream instability, including surface charge accumulation and communication system interference on spacecraft, are also explored. The findings show that, in the high-latitude polar cusp region, the interaction between the solar wind plasma propagating along magnetic field lines and the upward-moving ionospheric plasma could drive two-stream instability, leading to the formation of electron hole structures in phase space and triggering a bipolar distribution of ESWs. When the spatial magnetic field and wave vector meet specific conditions, the enhanced electron cyclotron motion could suppress the formation of two-stream instability and electron hole structures, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of the ESWs. The results offer valuable insights for a deeper understanding of the impact of solar storms on the polar cusp environment, as well as for monitoring electromagnetic environment and ensuring the stable operation of spacecraft.",

The present study explores a novel strategy for efficient ICP through using helicon antennas with zero external magnetic field. Specific research is devoted to the effects of antenna geometry (loop, half-helix, Boswell, Nagoya III), driving frequency (13.56-54.24 MHz) and radial density profile (Gaussian and parabolic) on power coupling. Findings reveal that: loop antenna yields higher power deposition efficiency than half-helix, Boswell, and Nagoya III antennas, driving frequency gives negligible effects, and parabolic density profile results in more efficient power coupling than Gaussian density profile especially in the radial direction, for the conditions employed here. Therefore, it is suggested that for this novel ICP strategy one should use loop antenna with parabolic density profile, and the industrial frequency of 13.56 MHz can work well. This study provides a valuable reference for the novel design of efficient ICP sources, which could be used for material processing and space propulsion, etc. Key words: Inductively coupled plasma; Antenna Geometry; Power Deposition; Driving Frequency",

It is an open question how to produce coherent radio emission in these systems, though a model driven by binary interaction seems likely given the nature and correlation of the emission with the binaries' orbital period. Using kinetic plasma simulations, we demonstrate that the relativistic electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) is a viable mechanism for generating radio pulses in white dwarf - M dwarf systems, akin to planetary radio emission, such as that from the Jupiter-Io system. We quantify the relativistic ECMI in the nonlinear regime under conditions relevant for white dwarf radio emission for the first time. Our simulations demonstrate that the ECMI can intrinsically produce partially linearly polarized emission relevant to explaining the observed emission spectrum of the two galactic sources, though the precise details will depend on the plasma composition. Our work paves the way for a systematic and fully nonlinear computational modeling of radio emission from interacting white dwarf sources.",

We have successfully achieved this using ultra-relativistic protons accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. In the first application of this experimental platform, the stability of the pair beam is studied as it propagates through a metre-length plasma, analogous to TeV $\\gamma$-ray induced pair cascades in the intergalactic medium. It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from $\\gamma$-ray observations of blazars is robust.",

    "abstract": "Two fluid simulations using local Landau-fluid closures derived from linear theory provide an efficient computational framework for plasma modelling, since they bridge the gap between computationally intensive kinetic simulations and fluid descriptions. Their accuracy in representing kinetic effects depends critically on the validity of the linear approximation used in the derivation: the plasma should not be too far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, LTE. However, many of the problems where these models are of particular interest (such as plasma turbulence and instabilities) are in fact quite far from LTE. The question then arises, if kinetic scale processes are still sufficiently well captured outside of the theoretical regime of applicability of the closure. In this paper, we show that two fluid simulations with Landau fluid closures can effectively reproduce the energy spectra obtained with fully kinetic Vlasov simulations, used as references, as long as the local closure parameter is appropriately chosen. Our findings validate the usage of two fluid simulations with Landau-fluid closure as a possible alternative to fully kinetic simulations of turbulence, in cases where being able to simulate extremely large domains is of particular interest.",

    "abstract": "The numerical flow iteration method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov--Poisson system. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) after certain time intervals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of the solution at the restart times using a randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm with lazy evaluation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure Numerical Flow Iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step while still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical results demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the Numerical Flow Iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the semi-Lagrangian method.",

Phys. 196, 448 (2004)), represents an induced RF sheath rectified potential in the plasma turbulence model. Flux-driven turbulence simulations demonstrate a realistic distribution of plasma profiles and fluctuations. There is a clear effect of the antenna sheath voltage leading to formation of convective cells; bias-induced convective transport flattens the SOL density profile and fluctuations penetrate into the shadow region of the limiters as the bias voltage increases. Turbulent transport for impurity ions is inferred by following ion trajectories in the simulated plasma turbulence fields, showing Bohm-like effective diffusion rates. All in all, the model elucidates the key physical phenomena governing the effects of ICRF-induced antenna biasing on the tokamak boundary plasma.",

    "abstract": "The Robinson Research Institute is developing a type of electric propulsion for spacecraft called an applied-field magneto-plasma-dynamic (AF-MPD) thruster. The applied field module of the thruster features a cryocooler-cooled high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) magnet generating central fields exceeding 1 Tesla. This paper reports on the progress to date of the thruster test facilities established at the Institute to enable development of the AF-MPD and electric propulsion in general. The vacuum facilities consist primarily of a 1 m diameter, 3 m3 cylindrical chamber with a high-vacuum pumping speed, measured to be about 4200 L/s (Ar). The chamber can be reduced from atmospheric pressure to 1E10-5 hPa in about 2 h, enabling a rapid testing turn-around time, and maintains 5E10-4 hPa during thruster operation at typical mass flow rates of 5 mg/s (Ar). A pendulum thrust-stand has been purpose built to withstands static thruster loads of up to 30 kg and measure thrust forces up to 200 mN. It is also designed to be inherently insensitive to the unique challenges of measuring AF-MPD with superconducting magnets; strong magnetic fields, cryocooler vibration, and the thermal gradients. Initial thrust-stand testing, whilst implementing both water-cooling and a cryocooler showed it to be capable of measuring forces to a precision of approximately 1 mN and with an absolute accuracy of +/-2.3 mN (full scale). An extensive suite of software tools has also been developed to coordinate the large set of instruments needed to run the vacuum facilities, the thrust-stand, HTS magnet and cryocooler in addition to the many other auxiliary- and logging systems. Various upgrades to the facilities are in progress or planned.",

    "abstract": "Transverse electromagnetic and electrostatic plasma wave modes propagating along a background magnetic field $\\vec{B}_0$ are independent according to linear kinetic theory. However, resonant interactions and energy exchange between waves and particles break this linear decoupling. This work tracks the coupled evolution of Alfv\\'en-cyclotron (ACWs) and Ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) by solving moment-based quasilinear equations for a collisionless plasma of bi-Maxwellian protons and Maxwellian electrons. Unlike earlier quasilinear studies that adopt the cold-electron limit, our formulation retains the full kinetic response of both species, treating the electrons as a thermal reservoir to isolate proton heating. A parameter survey over $0.01\\leq\\beta_{\\parallel p}\\leq10$ and $1\\le T_e/T_p\\le10$ shows that an ambient spectrum of ACWs can drive significant perpendicular proton heating and raise the temperature anisotropy from initially isotropic conditions at low $\\beta_{\\parallel p}\\lesssim0.1$, thereby triggering cyclotron instabilities. The quasilinear evolution self-regulates the ACW, driving the system toward a quasi-stationary state with $\\gamma/\\Omega_p<10^{-1}$ and reduced anisotropy. As $T_e/T_p$ increases, IAWs become less damped and absorb a larger share of the fluctuation energy through Landau resonance, reducing the efficiency of ACW-driven proton heating and thus regulating the instability. For sufficiently large $\\beta_{\\parallel p}$ or $T_e/T_p\\gtrsim5$, ACWs become inefficient drivers of perpendicular heating, leaving IAWs as the dominant dissipation channel. These results explain how modest electrostatic activity in low-$\\beta$ environments such as the inner heliosphere and planetary magnetosheaths can regulate, but not indefinitely sustain, cyclotron instabilities.",

    "abstract": "Geometrical optics (GO) is widely used for reduced modeling of waves in plasmas but fails near reflection points, where it predicts a spurious singularity of the wave amplitude. We show how to avoid this singularity by adopting a different representation of the wave equation. Instead of the physical space $x$ and the wavevector $k$, we use the ray time $\\tau$ as the new canonical coordinate and the ray energy $h$ as the associated canonical momentum. To derive the envelope equation in the $\\tau$-representation, we construct the Weyl symbol calculus on the $(\\tau, h)$ space and show that the corresponding Weyl symbols are related to their $(x, k)$ counterparts by the Airy transform. This allows us to express the coefficients in the envelope equation through the known properties of the original dispersion operator. When necessary, solutions of this equation can be mapped to the $x$-space using a generalised metaplectic transform. But the field per se might not even be needed in practice. Instead, knowing the corresponding Wigner function usually suffices for linear and quasilinear calculations. As a Weyl symbol itself, the Wigner function can be mapped analytically, using the aforementioned Airy transform. We show that the standard Airy patterns that form in regions where conventional GO fails are successfully reproduced within MGO simply by remapping the field from the $\\tau$-space to the $x$-space. An extension to mode-converting waves is also presented. This formulation, which we call generalised metaplectic GO (MGO) offers a promising tool, for example, for reduced modeling of the O--X conversion in inhomogeneous plasma near the critical density, an effect that is important for fusion applications and also occurs in the ionosphere. Aside from better handling reflection, MGO is similar to GO and can replace it for any practical purposes.",

    "abstract": "We perform extensive 2D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) electromagnetic simulations of low pressure Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) discharges with various coil current and driving frequencies. Our simulations show that in low-frequency cases, electrons in the skin region near the coil can be predominantly magnetized by the Radio Frequency (RF) magnetic field. More specifically, the electrons are trapped in the combined potential well formed by the vector and electrostatic potentials, where they oscillate for most of the RF period while drifting perpendicular to the RF magnetic field. When the magnetic field weakens, electrons shortly demagnetize, leading to jet-like currents and periodic bursts of energy deposition. Based on the newly discovered electron trajectories, we develop a new kinetic theory for the plasma skin effect in low-frequency Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) discharges, incorporating nonlinear electron motion in an RF magnetic field by integrating Vlasov equation along the unperturbed particle trajectory. This theory successfully predicts the time evolution of electron currents in low-frequency ICP plasmas, as well as a nonlinear relation between electron current and the RF inductive electric field in the new regime we found. Furthermore, by coupling this new kinetic theory with a global model, we provide a straightforward method for estimating equilibrium electron temperature, plasma density and electron current. These analytical predictions match well with our 2D PIC simulations and can be validated through future experimental studies.",

Our model incorporates an extensive chemical reaction network to simulate the neutral-neutral and ion-neutral reactions occurring in the COSmIC experiments when using N2-CH4-based gas mixtures relevant to Titan's atmosphere. Our reaction network now includes crucial reactions involving the first electronically-excited state of atomic nitrogen, recent electron collision cross-sections, and radical chemistry. In particular, we have investigated the influence of C2H2 on the gas phase polymeric growth and the elemental composition of the chemical products, and we have compared our findings to recently published solid phase analyses. The modeling results are consistent with experimental measurements of N2-CH4-C2H2 plasmas on COSmIC, showing the production of C6Hx intermediates and precursors of larger organics, as well as methanimine in small concentration. Our numerical results point to cationic pathways enabling efficient intermediate-sized and nitrogen-rich \\ce{C2H2}-driven chemistry driving tholin production. Comparison of the modeled gas phase elemental composition with elemental composition of the solid phase samples produced in COSmIC reveal similar trends, with C/N increasing when C2H2 is present in the gas mixture.

To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.",

Under this context, a family of kappa distributions has been widely used to capture the high-energy tails in space plasmas. These distributions deviate from the canonical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and vary significantly in their interpretation of the temperature of an out-of-equilibrium system. In this letter, we establish the validity of any kappa distribution from the standpoint of superstatistics. This study unifies these models by introducing a new kappa distribution based on superstatistical parameters, providing a more general and fundamental framework to connect these distributions and the superstatistical temperature of a system. We demonstrate that the general distribution depends on the thermal characteristics of the modeled temperature distribution population. Furthermore, we present a moment-based velocity distribution that bypasses the traditional temperature debate, relying on the velocity moments. Our findings enhance the understanding of kappa distributions and offer a robust model for non-equilibrium space plasmas.",

We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a reconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed distributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in fully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic parameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the need for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the observed particle energization more accurately.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.",

    "abstract": "In high-energy astrophysics, interpreting observed spectra hinges on understanding the competition between energy gains and radiative losses. To progress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of particle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas including synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle energy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond with a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles cool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\\sigma \\approx 1 $ and amplitude $\\delta B/B_0\\simeq 1$), the particle distribution follows ${\\rm d}n/{\\rm d}\\gamma\\propto \\gamma^{-s}$ with $s\\simeq 3$ below the predicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\\simeq 4$ above. The particle distribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability near the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy turn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the acceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose maximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are accelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by a gradient of the $4$--velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of relativistic amplitude, $\\delta u_E \\gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable to the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence. Lastly, we apply our results to the Crab nebula, which exhibits a hierarchy of characteristic Lorentz factors similar to that studied here. We conclude that stochastic acceleration in this environment is a promising mechanism for explaining the highest-energy part of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and its variability.

Using the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model and the reductive perturbation technique, a generalized Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation was derived, and stationary analytical solutions were obtained. The analysis revealed that superthermal electrons substantially influence the amplitude, width, and polarity of EADLs. Numerical results indicated that decreasing the spectral index kappa or increasing the relative density of kappa electrons to hot electrons intensifies nonlinear effects, producing stronger compressive and rarefactive structures. It is also found that kappa plays a more dominant role than the density ratio in controlling EADL properties in dense astrophysical environments.",

As the wave compresses and accelerates the plasma, weak reflection seeds a periodic train of density spikes that grow rapidly due to mass symmetry.

In our earlier work, the LMV-Informed Neural Network (LINN) (Luo et al., arXiv:2506.16619) combined prior knowledge from the LMV model with kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) data to improve kernel-based heat-flux predictions. While effective under moderately nonlocal conditions, LINN produced physically inconsistent kernels in strongly time-dependent regimes due to its reliance on the quasi-stationary LMV formulation. To overcome this limitation, TCNN is designed to capture the coupled evolution of both the normalized heat flux and the characteristic nonlocality parameter using a unified neural architecture informed by underlying physical principles. Trained on fully kinetic PIC simulations, TCNN accurately reproduces nonlocal dynamics across a broad range of collisionalities. Our results demonstrate that the combination of time modulation, coupled prediction, and convolutional depth significantly enhances predictive performance, offering a data-driven yet physically consistent framework for multiscale plasma transport problems.",

This range is defined as the density interval within which these resonant modes still exhibit growth in homogeneous plasmas. This range properly characterizes the spatial growth region of the resonant absolute modes in a series of linear fluid simulations across broad parameter spaces. Building on this insight, we investigate the absolute growth of TPD modes driven by laser pulses with intensity modulations, a common feature in broadband lasers used to suppress laser plasma instabilities.

Neural network (NN) surrogates offer accelerated inference with fully differentiable approximations that enable gradient-based coupling but typically require large training datasets to capture transport flux variations across plasma conditions, creating significant training burden and limiting applicability to expensive gyrokinetic simulations. We propose \\textbf{TGLF-SINN (Spectra-Informed Neural Network)} with three key innovations: (1) principled feature engineering that reduces target prediction range, simplifying the learning task; (2) physics-guided regularization of transport spectra to improve generalization under sparse data; and (3) Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) to strategically select training samples based on model uncertainty, reducing data requirements while maintaining accuracy. Our approach achieves superior performance with significantly less training data. In offline settings, TGLF-SINN reduces logarithmic root mean squared error (LRMSE) by 12. 4\\% compared to the current baseline \\base. Using only 25\\% of the complete dataset with BAL, we achieve LRMSE only 0.0165 higher than \\base~and 0.0248 higher than our offline model (0.0583).

    "abstract": "Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver. Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.",

We systematically characterize the energy transferred to a series victim load across a broad range of resistances (0.1 to 10,000Ohm) and circuit parameters, including capacitance and gap length. Our results show that the fraction of stored energy delivered to the victim load is largely independent of gap length. We demonstrate that the classic Rompe-Weizel spark resistance model effectively predicts the scaling of this energy transfer, establishing a clear link between spark resistance and energy partitioning. These findings provide a valuable, predictive framework for guiding safety requirements for sensitive electronic components and energetic materials and will inform the development of more accurate circuit models for ESD events.",

However, anomalous energy modulations in recoil deuterons have been observed in several high-yield indirect drive experiments ($Y_n\\sim10^{16}-10^{18}$). These observations raise concerns about their potential impact on the MRS-inferred performance metrics. Analytic calculations and particle-in-cell simulations are used to examine the possible beam-plasma instabilities, which indicate the two-stream instability as the driving mechanism behind energy modulations.

We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.",

Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that there exists viscous-like energy conversion in collisionless plasma with scaling characteristics analogous to collisional plasma, and in particular that the average dissipation is proportional to the square of the rate of strain as in hydrodynamics. In this study, using 2.5D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of collisionless plasma turbulence, we provide an estimate of effective viscosity at each scale, obtained via a scale-filtering approach. We then compare the turbulent dynamics of the PIC simulation with that from MHD and two-fluid simulations in which with the viscosity is equal to the effective viscosity estimate obtained from the PIC simulation. We find that the global behavior in these MHD and two-fluid simulations has a striking similarity with that in its kinetic/PIC counterpart. In addition, we explore the scale dependence of the effective viscosity, and discuss implications of this approach for space plasmas.",

    "abstract": "The Multi-Mode Model (MMM) for turbulent transport was applied to a large set of well-analyzed discharges from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) in order to evaluate its sensitivities to a wide range of plasma conditions. MMM calculations were performed for hundreds of milliseconds in each discharge by performing time-dependent predictive simulations with the 1.5D tokamak integrated modeling code TRANSP. A closely related study concluded that MMM predicted electron ($T_e$) and ion ($T_i$) temperature profiles that were in reasonable agreement with NSTX observations, generally outperforming a different reduced transport model, TGLF, motivating a more thorough investigation of the characteristics of the MMM predictions. The simulations with MMM have electron energy transport dominated by electron temperature gradient modes for relatively low plasma $\\beta$ and high collisionality, transitioning to a mixture of different modes for higher $\\beta$ and lower collisionality. The thermal ion diffusivity predicted by MMM is much smaller than the neoclassical contribution, in line with previous experimental analysis of NSTX. Nonetheless, the $T_e$ and $T_i$ profiles are coupled via collisional energy exchange and thus sensitive to which transport channels are predicted. The simulations with MMM are robust to the simulation start time, converging to remarkably similar temperatures later during the discharge. MMM typically overpredicts confinement relative to NSTX observations, leading to the prediction of overly steep profiles. Plasmas with spatially broader $T_e$ profiles, higher $\\beta$, and longer energy confinement times tend to be predicted by MMM with better agreement with the experiment. These findings provide useful context for understanding the regime-dependent tendencies of MMM in anticipation of self-consistent, time-dependent predictive simulations of NSTX-U discharges.",

Overall, it is found that simulations using the Multi-Mode Model (MMM) more consistently agree with the NSTX observations than those using the Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) model, despite TGLF requiring orders of magnitude greater computational cost. When considering all examined discharges, MMM has median overpredictions of electron temperature ($T_e$) and ion temperature ($T_i$) profiles of 28% and 27%, respectively, relative to the experiment. TGLF overpredicts $T_e$ by 46%, with much larger variance than MMM, and underpredicts $T_i$ by 25%. As $\\beta$ is increased across NSTX discharges, TGLF predicts lower $T_e$ and significant flattening of the $T_i$ profile, conflicting with NSTX observations. When using an electrostatic version of TGLF, both $T_e$ and $T_i$ are substantially overpredicted, underscoring the importance of electromagnetic turbulence in the high $\\beta$ spherical tokamak regime. Additionally, calculations with neural net surrogate models for TGLF were performed outside of TRANSP with a time slice flux matching transport solver, finding better agreement with experiment than the TRANSP simulations, highlighting the impact of different transport solvers and simulation techniques. Altogether, the reasonable agreement with experiment of temperature profiles predicted by MMM motivates a more detailed examination of the sensitivities of the TRANSP simulations with MMM to different NSTX plasma regimes in a companion paper, in preparation for self-consistent, time-dependent predictive modeling of NSTX-U scenarios.",

Given the relatively small size of the single-machine dataset, kernel density estimation was employed to minimize sampling bias and bootstrapping was used to give a realistic estimate of the large uncertainties from the regression. The resulting power law shows a robustly stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation as compared to the H-mode scaling law.",

Despite the compressible and inhomogeneous nature of Eulerian gyrocenter drifts, numerical simulations with the T3ST code reveal approximate ergodicity, stationarity, and time-symmetry.

    "abstract": "Commemorating the 2024 S. Chandrasekhar Prize, this review provides a retrospective on the genesis and evolution of plasma wakefield acceleration. It traces the journey from prehistory and the invention of the Plasma Wakefield Accelerator (PWFA), the establishment of its theoretical cornerstones, to its profound reverberations across fundamental physics, including astrophysics and analog gravity. The narrative emphasizes conceptual evolution, key theoretical breakthroughs, and future outlook, culminating in a vision for hybrid schemes and next-generation colliders. In addition to application to particle accelerators and high energy collider physics, it is found that plasma wakefield, with its ultra-intense acceleration, can also be applied to investigate gravity effects in the laboratory based on Einstein's equivalence principle. A specific example is accelerating flying relativistic plasma mirrors to investigate the celebrated black hole Hawking evaporation and the associated information loss paradox. We describe an ongoing experiment, AnaBHEL (Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers), which aims at shedding some lights on the black hole information loss paradox.",

    "abstract": "We reproduce the consistently-seen experimental voltage versus pressure (V-P) dependence of DC magnetron sputtering (DCMS) with 2D-RZ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. Informed by PIC simulation, we develop a steady-state, 1D-axial fluid model of the sheath and presheath that also reproduces this V-P dependence. The V-P dependence is the relationship between the steady-state voltage needed to maintain a constant discharge current and the neutral gas pressure. V-P dependence is fundamental to device performance, but has not previously been reproduced with simulation or satisfactorily explained. In this work, we compare the V-P curve of our simulated device and fluid model with past experiments and then present a theoretical explanation for this V-P dependence. We find that the decrease in voltage with increasing pressure is not due to electron recapture at the cathode. Rather, the constant current dictates a constant global ionization rate, so the voltage decrease compensates for the increase in neutral gas density by lowering the energy of the plasma electrons, which decreases their ionization probability. The PIC simulations also reveal that the presheath and bulk plasma are unaffected by the electron reflection coefficient at the cathode; the only effect of increasing reflection is a reduction in the sheath voltage and width. In addition to the potential structure, we explore how pressure affects the plasma density, particle drifts, and particle energy distributions.",

This entails showing that the exact magnetic moment of Qin and Davidson can be constructed to be asymptotic to the adiabatic invariant series of Kruskal. In contrast to the perturbative invariant, the exact invariant contains information about parametric resonances. These resonances destroy the conservation of the usual magnetic moment over very long times. This refutes some previous claims about the all-time invariance of the magnetic moment.",

    "abstract": "Advanced tokamak regimes, featuring extended regions of low magnetic shear, are promising candidates for future fusion reactors but are also more prone to specific kinds of MHD instabilities. The proximity to a rational surface in a very low shear region weakens field line bending stabilisation and amplifies the effects of toroidal coupling between modes, leading to the emergence of long-wavelength resistive infernal modes. These modes can grow collectively as a discrete spectrum, leading to a cascade of different perturbations for single mode numbers $(m, n)$, with subdominant modes showing increasingly oscillatory radial structures. These spectra of fast-growing modes are significant for developing stable scenarios in future reactors, and for the understanding of global reconnection events like sawteeth, motivating a deeper investigation into their fundamental physics. Deriving new analytic solutions, including a generalisation of the ideal interchange dispersion relation to non monotonic $q$ profiles, and extending a modular linear resistive MHD solver, we investigate how resistivity, compressibility, toroidal effects, and shaping influence stability, especially in reversed shear $q$ profiles. It is also shown that common assumptions in numerical calculations prevent the observation of the full variety of modes present in these advanced scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota & Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.",

    "abstract": "We present an extended investigation of a recently introduced model of gravitationally confined, collisionless plasma (Barbieri et al. 2024a), which showed that rapid temperature fluctuations at the base of the plasma, occurring on timescales much shorter than the electron crossing time, can drive the system into a non-thermal state characterized by anti-correlated temperature and density profiles, commonly referred to as temperature inversion. To describe this phenomenon, a temporal coarse-graining formalism was developed (Barbieri et al. 2024b). In this work, we generalize that approach to cover regimes where the timescales of temperature fluctuations are comparable to or exceed the electron crossing time. We derive a set of kinetic equations that incorporate an additional term arising from the coarse-graining procedure, which was not present in the earlier formulation. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the plasma dynamics under these broader conditions, showing that the electric field influences the system when fluctuation timescales approach the electron crossing time. However, for timescales much larger than the proton crossing time, the electric field becomes negligible. The observed behaviours are interpreted within the framework of the extended temporal coarse-graining theory, and we identify the regimes and conditions in which temperature inversion persists.",

In such environments, gravity tends to separate charged species. To prevent separation an electric field, classically described by the Pannekoek-Rosseland expression, is usually imposed externally. Here, we propose a self-consistent method to recover this field based on a multi-mode Fourier expansion of the electrostatic interaction. We show that, under suitable conditions, this approach naturally leads to the ambipolar electric field and restores charge neutrality. The method is tested in both isothermal and multi-temperature plasma configurations. This framework provides a foundation for future developments that may include collisions, ionization, and asymmetric boundary conditions to model more realistic stellar atmospheres.",

Until now, no direct observations have confirmed their role in the heating of the atmosphere. Here, we present the first direct evidence that solar vortices act as structured waveguides, carrying magnetoacoustic modes (waves that behave like sound waves but travel through magnetized plasma) that leave clear wave-heating signatures. By mapping vortex regions at multiple heights and analysing the waves they contain, we show that magnetoacoustic waves efficiently transfer energy, offset losses from radiation, and dominate energy transport in the lower chromosphere. These results challenge the long-standing assumption that vortices primarily support twisting disturbances traveling along magnetic field lines (Alfven waves), revealing instead that magnetoacoustic modes play the leading role in the lower atmosphere. This redefines the role of vortices in magnetized plasmas and has broader implications for wave-plasma interactions in regions of strong magnetic fields.",

    "abstract": "With edge plasma code SOLS-ITER, we study four Snowflake (SF) configurations for an ITER-size tokamak, with toroidal magnetic field BT=5T, major radius R=5m and plasma current Ip=10MA. Our aim is to provide insights on SF divertor design for future devices. In this work, the impacts of magnetic geometry and divertor target geometry in the four types of SF configurations on plasma behavior and power exhaust performance are investigated in detail. Low-recycling regime, high-recycling and detachment in the four types of SF divertors are obtained through an upstream density scan. The secondary X-point positions of SF divertors are systematically varied to examine their impact. For Low-Field-Side (LFS) SF- and High-Field-Side (HFS) SF- divertors the observed power splitting, induced by the secondary X-point, is consistent with experimental observations. The effect of target geometry is studied by comparing the flat target plates with the ITER-like divertor shape. The overall simulation results reveal a notable consequence of the LFS SF- divertor: closed structure of the inner target with high inclined plate can compress recycling neutrals originating from the HFS divertor region into the LFS SOL and PFR regions. This results in considerable volumetric dissipation through strong ionization and recombination, causing the connected outer target region to detach. This feature can be considered in the design of the LFS SF- divertor for future devices. For the LFS and HFS SF+ divertors, the region between the two X-points exhibits strong ionization and recombination sources close to the primary X-point. This feature might be beneficial for the formation of an X-point radiator, but would require further impurity seeding simulation study.",

    "abstract": "In a small spherical tokamak with minor radius of 0.22 m and toroidal magnetic field of 1 T, it is possible to heat ions of a sufficiently dense plasma to an extremely high temperature up to 50 million Kelvin. To do this, it is necessary to transfer a sufficiently large torque to stabilize ion-scale turbulence and achieve ion heat transport at neoclassical level reaching extremely low values of plasma collisionality. It is also necessary to ensure good thermal insulation of electrons, which is always determined by turbulent transport. In a spherical tokamak, the toroidal magnetic field has a strong beneficial effect on suppressing turbulent electron heat fluxes. In the Globus-M2 tokamak, when heating plasma with high-energy atomic beams, a significant improvement in the plasma thermal energy confinement is observed with an increase in the toroidal magnetic field from 0.5 to 1 T. The comparison of our results with experiments on ST40 tokamak operating with toroidal magnetic field of 2 T indicates that further strong improvement of thermal insulation of spherical tokamak plasma in the region of higher magnetic fields is not expected.",

First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective \"shaping currents\" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Amp\\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the fabrication of large aperture phase optics, ultra-intense relativistic laser plasma interaction (RLPI) experiments with complex polarization states are becoming feasible. In this work, we perform a computational investigation of direct acceleration of electrons produced during ionization of underdense neon gas using a tightly focused and radially polarized Petawatt-class short pulse lasers by numerically solving the relativistically invariant Lorentz equations, incorporating semi-classical tunneling ionization and Monte Carlo type sampling of the focal volume. The accelerated electrons energy gain increases at longer laser wavelengths and GeV energies are reached for electrons ionized from the neon inner shells, which are field ionized near the peak of the pulse. Backward acceleration of electrons is observed for a range of initial positions and phases of ionization of neon charge states. This apparent counterintuitive phenomenon is directly linked to the radial polarization state of the incident laser beam that results in a strong longitudinal electric field Ez when tightly focused, where electrons ionized near the focal center at the phase when Ez is pointed toward the forward propagation direction experiences an initial push in the backward direction. A parametric study of the phenomenon by varying laser parameters is presented, and a 3D particle in cell (PIC) simulation is considered to confirm the existence of this phenomenon.",

MHD equilibria in toroidal configuration from circular cross-sections to realistic CFETR-like scenarios with various magnetic shear profiles are considered. Two critical aspects of the $n=1$ RWM are examined: the influence of toroidal rotation on the unstable regime and the toroidal rotation frequency thresholds required for complete stabilization. It is found that strongly reversed magnetic shear consistently broadens the unstable $\\beta_{\\rm N}$ window in both circular and CFETR equilibria when toroidal rotation is included. Furthermore, reversed magnetic shear significantly reduces the rotational stabilization, resulting in narrower stability windows and notably higher toroidal rotation frequency thresholds required for complete RWM suppression compared to the cases with positive shear only. These results clearly demonstrate that the reversed magnetic shear in the advanced tokamak configuration imposes more stringent requirement for the effective toroidal rotation stabilization of the $n=1$ RWM.",

In this work, a low frequency (100 kHz) tailored pulse-wave-shaped bias voltage waveform is applied to the substrate electrode of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and its effects on the IEDF, electron density, electron dynamics and the etch rates of silicon dioxide as well as amorphous silicon are investigated in a commercial 200 mm reactive ion etching (RIE) reactor. While the tailored waveform substrate bias hardly affects the electron density above the substrate and the spatio-temporally resolved electron power absorption dynamics, it is found to affect the ion flux to the substrate at high ICP source powers. Monoenergetic IEDFs with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) below 10 eV are realized with mean ion energies ranging from 20 eV to 100 eV in both argon and SF6. Such monoenergetic IEDFs are used to determine the Ar ion sputter threshold energies of amorphous silicon and silicon dioxide to be 23 eV and 37 eV, respectively, and to realize selective etching of these two materials by Ar ion sputtering based on tailoring the IEDF to ensure that all incident ions are within this narrow ion energy selectivity window.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is one of the most important magnetic energy conversion processes observed in laboratory and space plasmas. It describes the breaking and joining of magnetic field lines, leading to the release of magnetic energy and the acceleration of charged particles. Finding regions where fast reconnection occurs is key to understanding this process. However, identifying such reconnection events within a turbulent environment in three dimensions remains a challenge. In this work, we develop a new framework for identifying magnetic reconnection using 3D turbulent plasma simulations. First, we apply bifurcation lines from fluid visualization to magnetic fields and show that they can be identified with X-lines of magnetic reconnection. For reconnection configurations with magnetic guide fields, we introduce a novel concept of quasi X-lines (QXL). Using the spatial information of X-lines in numerical simulations, we present a local technique to estimate the reconnection rate, obtaining a distribution that features a local maximum near the normalized value 0.1. Additionally, we provide an alternative tool to highlight current sheets in turbulent plasma by measuring magnetic shear layers as the second invariant of the shear strain tensor. These methods, avoiding traditional reliance on global methods, electric fields and current density, offer a new perspective to the quantitative study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with complex magnetic field topologies. Validated across various plasma simulation models, including kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), our approach enables efficient exploration of magnetic field dynamics in turbulent plasma environments.",

This spectrum has been utilized to calculate the temperature and angular distribution of deuterium ions transported in plasma.

    "abstract": "The computation of radiative opacity or emissivity of hot dense matter is a challenging task. It requires accounting for an immense number of energy levels and lines across various excitation and ionization states. Whether in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or non-LTE plasmas, statistical methods provide significant assistance. Many computational codes are based on the Detailed Configuration Accounting approximation, which involves averaged rates between configurations. In that approach, only the mean energies of the configurations are considered, and the effects of the energy distributions of the levels within the initial and final configurations are typically neglected. A long time ago, Klapisch proposed a method to correct the rates. The corresponding formalism includes the energy shift and variance of the Unresolved Transition Array, as well as the average energies of the configurations. We extend this formalism and investigate its impact on opacity calculations in two specific cases: first, the iron experiment conducted at Sandia National Laboratories under conditions similar to those at the base of the Sun's convective zone, dominated by L-shell 2p-$n$d transitions, and second, laser experiments--still for iron--at much lower temperature. The latter measurements shed light on our understanding of the envelopes of $\\beta$-Cephei-type stars, where the relevant transitions are intra-M-shell $\\Delta n=0$ (3-3) transitions, specifically 3s-3p and 3p-3d, in the XUV range. The issue of ensuring the validity of Kirchhoff's law when plasmas approach LTE is also addressed, and a prescription is proposed, applying both to the standard configuration-to-configuration case and to the aforementioned corrections, which account for the energy distribution of the levels within a configuration.",

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger, relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to $80\\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field regime, while contributing minimally ($\\approx 3\\%$) to magnetic energy dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.",

These models are disparate, so experimental comparisons and evaluations are important. Polycrystalline material in a state of hydrostatic pressure, will have no eccentricity of X-ray diffracted Debye-Scherrer rings. A general three-dimensional solution of Bragg diffracted X-rays based on principal crystallographic strains in the compression wave was found. The distortion of X-ray diffraction beams has been used for strain measurements; the analysis developed incorporates a strained reciprocal lattice and the incident X-ray beam. Strain distorted Polanyi surfaces form an annulus of compression with an ellipsoid of revolution in reciprocal space which is intersected by Ewald sphere for Bragg diffraction. The in-situ measurements for strain describe nanosecond diffraction evaluated using two planes, and both in the same crystallographic phase. Diffraction from Al, Ni, Na, and Invar quantify the compression axial strains in these materials: the compression axial ratios are 0.65, 1.05, 0.88 and 1.58 at pressures of 291, 402, 409, and 367 GPa for the respective materials.

    "abstract": "The design of inertial fusion experiments is a complex task as driver energy must be delivered in a precise manner to a structured target to achieve a fast, but hydrodynamically stable, implosion. Radiation-hydrodynamics simulation codes are an essential tool in this design process. However, multi-dimensional simulations that capture hydrodynamic instabilities are more computationally expensive than optimistic, 1D, spherically symmetric simulations which are often the primary design tool. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework that aims to effectively use information from a large number of 1D simulations to inform design in the presence of hydrodynamic instabilities. We use an ensemble of neural network surrogate models trained on both 1D and 2D data to capture the space of good designs, i.e. those that are robust to hydrodynamic instabilities. We use this surrogate to perform Bayesian optimisation to find optimal designs for a 25 kJ laser driver. We perform hydrodynamic scaling on these designs to confirm the achievement of high gain for a 2 MJ laser driver, using 2D simulations including alpha heating effects.",

It is shown that in localized domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop, initiated by microwave radiation within the initial stoichiometric reaction mixture of ultrafine barium carbonate and titanium dioxide powders, the synthesis can proceed within 1,5 - 7 minutes, achieving a target product yield of up to 90%. Based on a developed realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave power of 400 W.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy using very high-energy electron (VHEE) beams generated by a laser-plasma accelerator has garnered significant interest due to its dose distribution capabilities and potential to address limitations of traditional photon-based radiotherapy. To explore the feasibility of such approach, the presented study uses the parameters of OONA, the commercial <1.3\\,J, <25\\,fs pulse duration laser recently installed at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Through particle-in-cell simulations of laser-plasma interaction, realistic electron beams were obtained. After filtering and collimation with a beamline and arranging them into an array of pencil beams, their radiotherapeutic potential was investigated. GEANT4 simulations were used to calculate the dose deposition in water phantoms and heterogeneous phantoms with bone inserts, considering realistic beam parameters for laser-plasma accelerators. Multifield irradiation setup and the dose distribution at the isocenter through different incidence angles were studied, simulating an intensity-modulated delivery. Our findings demonstrate that polychromatic VHEE beams generated from laser-plasma accelerators, when collimated using a compact beamline of quadrupoles and dipoles, can deliver an on-axis dose with enhanced precision and uniformity. This study highlights the transformative potential of laser-plasma accelerators in advancing radiotherapy modalities, paving the way for further research and clinical implementation.",

The basic idea is to treat the entire scattering process as the superposition of individual photon-electron interactions. We introduce macro-particles, referred from particle-in-cell simulations, to reduce the computational cost, and obtain scattered spectra within a reasonable computational time. Since the velocity of the interacting electron is randomly sampled from an electron distribution function, the method can be applied to arbitrary electron distribution functions provided an appropriate sampling scheme is available. We present simulation results for relativistic Maxwellian and kappa distribution functions, and compare them with both analytical and numerical spectra for validation. The simulated spectra show good agreement with both analytical and numerical results, demonstrating that the Monte Carlo simulation method can reliably reproduce incoherent Thomson scattering spectra.",

The parametric analysis carried out with FLUKA in the presence of magnetic fields indicated a clear relationship between the beam impact angle and the material deposited energy, demonstrating that higher impact angles lead to deeper electron penetration and greater deposited energies. A finite element model based on apparent heat capacity formulation in FreeFem++ was developed to analyze the material thermal response to such thermal loads using volumetric energy density profiles from FLUKA simulations as input.

    "title": "On the Regulation of the Solar Wind Helium Abundance by the Hydrogen Compressibility",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, fast solar wind is considered to originate in solar source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere and slow wind originates in regions that are intermittently open to it. In fast wind, the gradient of the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind speed ($v_\\mathrm{sw}$) is $\\sim0$ and $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\\sim50\\%$ of the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large, $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\\sim50\\%$ value. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches 1, this is not universally true and Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) show that $\\nabla_{v_\\mathrm{sw}} \\! A_\\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases with decreasing $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$. We show that these large gradients are due to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar wind's compressibility ($\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$), there are two subsets of enhanced $A_\\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with a large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently open sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these fluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\\'en wave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely analogous to the Alfv\\'enic slow wind. Mapping the results of this work to Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) and vice versa shows that, in any given $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$ quantile, $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right| \\lesssim 0.65$, an upper bound on non-Alfv\\'enic cross helicity. Similarly, $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right| \\lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$ quantile, is an upper bound on incompressible fluctuations. We conclude that $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$ is essential for characterizing the solar wind helium abundance and possibly regulating it.",

Recent theories further suggest that shock-shock collisions in stellar clusters could provide the additional acceleration needed to explain the observed high-energy CR spectrum. Here, we investigate this hypothesis through a laser-based experiment that creates magnetized plasma conditions similar to astrophysical environments. Our results demonstrate that interpenetrating collisionless shocks can significantly boost the energy of ambient protons previously energized by the individual shocks, while also improving the overall acceleration efficiency. Numerical kinetic simulations corroborate these findings, revealing that protons are reaccelerated via their bouncing motion in the convective electric fields of the colliding magnetized flows. By allowing to highly energize ambient protons, our novel colliding-shock platform opens the prospect to test the long-discussed mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting.",

    "abstract": "A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.",

However, the energy still appears to be underestimated at low temperatures, as indicated by comparisons with the recent path integral Monte Carlo calculations [Phys. Plasmas 31, 110501 (2024)]. Using the presented method, we analyze the dependence of radial distribution functions, composition, ionization degree, energy, and pressure on the plasma coupling parameter, while maintaining a fixed degeneracy parameter. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of incorporating long-range interactions on the energy $N$-dependence by utilizing the angular-averaged Ewald potential.

    "abstract": "This study explores the transitional characteristics of blue-core helicon discharge, which to our knowledge was not particularly focused on before. Parameters are measured on recently built advanced linear plasma device, i.e. Multiple Plasma Simulation Linear Device (MPS-LD) by various diagnostics including Langmuir probe, optical emission spectrometer, and standard high-speed camera. It is found that the jump direction of electron density (from low level to high level) is opposite to that of electron temperature (from high level to low level). Electron density increases significantly and the radial profile becomes localized near the axis when the blue-core transition occurs. With increased field strength, electron density increases whereas electron temperature drops. The radial profile of electron temperature looks like a ``W\" shape, i.e. minimizing around the edge of blue-core column. Electron density increases with background pressure, while electron temperature peaks around certain pressure value. High-speed videos show that the plasma column oscillates radially and experiences azimuthal instabilities with high rate once entered blue-core mode. An electromagnetic solver (EMS) based on Maxwell's equations and a cold-plasma dielectric tensor is also employed to compute the wave field and power absorption during blue-core transition, to provide more details that are valuable for understanding the transitional physics but not yet available in experiment. The results show that wave field in both radial and axial directions changes significantly during the transition, its structure differs from antenna to downstream, and the power dependence of wave magnetic field is overall opposite to that of wave electric field. This work presents comprehensive characteristics of the transitional blue-core discharge and is important to both physics understanding and practical applications.",

A new expression for the ponderomotive force (PF) -- which acts as the main driver of THz radiation at the vacuum-plasma boundary -- is derived to capture the hitherto unexplored effects of phase asymmetry intrinsic to the M-pulse, in contrast to a single B-pulse where its phase is irrelevant. This PF formulation captures the underlying cycle-to-cycle symmetry-breaking for the M-pulse field, responsible for efficient THz emission. We demonstrate analytically that such M-pulses of the same total energy as a B-pulse may generate significantly enhanced PF, leading to THz yields several orders of magnitude higher. With a judicious choice of low-frequency to high-frequency ratio, the M-pulse configuration is shown to emerge as a highly efficient, phase-controllable driver of   THz radiation and offers a promising route for optimizing THz source design via tailored two-color laser-plasma interactions.",

    "title": "Pulsed laser synthesis of mesoporous metal chalcogenide thin films",
    "abstract": "Mesoporous films of the metal chalcogenide $\\beta$-FeSe were grown on MgO substrates by KrF pulsed laser deposition (PLD) in an argon background. At 100 mTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe measurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth initially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume interactions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex dynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding between the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume interior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\\le$0.5 eV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films grown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\\circ$C, a laser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction indicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate and likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very small nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films from atomic constituents. The in-plane orientation of the mesoporous films was $\\beta$-FeSe[100]$\\parallel$[110]MgO, attributed to the soft landing of pre-formed crystallites on the MgO substrates, where protruding Se rows of $\\beta$-FeSe aligned with corrugations of the MgO surface. This work implies that growth of candidate electrocatalyst materials by PLD in inert gas background may allow mesoporous frameworks with a single crystallographic orientation that expose specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions and active site engineering.",
