    "abstract": "Structures in tokamak plasmas are elongated along the direction of the magnetic field and short in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. Many tokamak simulation codes take advantage of this by using a field aligned coordinate system. However, field aligned coordinate systems have a coordinate singularity at magnetic X-points where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes, which makes it difficult to use field aligned coordinate systems when simulating the core and scrape-off layer (SOL) simultaneously. Here we present an algorithm for computing geometric quantities in a standard field aligned coordinate system that avoids the singularity and allows one to conduct 2D axisymmetric simulations in X-point geometries. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm with an example simulation of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP).",

These systems support various types of particle acceleration and radiation through a variety of mechanisms.

The radiative processes involved in the Weibel instability filament building are also discussed in relation to jitter and synchrotron radiation.",

    "abstract": "Low-temperature plasmas are essential to both fundamental scientific research and critical industrial applications. As in many areas of science, numerical simulations have become a vital tool for uncovering new physical phenomena and guiding technological development. Code benchmarking remains crucial for verifying implementations and evaluating performance. This work continues the Landmark benchmark initiative, a series specifically designed to support the verification of low-temperature plasma codes. In this study, seventeen simulation codes from a collaborative community of nineteen international institutions modeled a partially magnetized ExB Penning discharge. The emergence of large scale coherent structures, or rotating plasma spokes, endows this configuration with an enormous range of time scales, making it particularly challenging to simulate. The codes showed excellent agreement on the rotation frequency of the spoke as well as key plasma properties, including time-averaged ion density, plasma potential, and electron temperature profiles. Achieving this level of agreement came with challenges, and we share lessons learned on how to conduct future benchmarking campaigns. Comparing code implementations, computational hardware, and simulation runtimes also revealed interesting trends, which are summarized with the aim of guiding future plasma simulation software development.",

    "abstract": "Astrophysical systems exhibit a rich diversity of outflow morphologies, yet their mechanisms and existence conditions remain among the most persistent puzzles in the field. Here we present scaled laboratory experiments based on laser-driven plasma outflow into magnetized ambient gas, which mimic five basic astrophysical outflows regulated by interstellar medium, namely collimated jets, blocked jets, elliptical bubbles, as well as spherical winds and bubbles. Their morphologies and existence conditions are found to be uniquely determined by the external Alfvenic and sonic Mach numbers Me-a and Me-s, i.e. the relative strengths of the outflow ram pressure against the magnetic/thermal pressures in the interstellar medium, with transitions occurring at Me-a ~ 2 and 0.5, as well as Me-s ~ 1. These results are confirmed by magnetohydrodynamics simulations and should also be verifiable from existing and future astronomical observations. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding astrophysical outflows.",

    "abstract": "We present two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical at intermittent structures in plasma turbulence. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. The interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked by a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by KH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the interaction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are stochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear layer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process takes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI interaction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles produced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are present in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such as in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc., and highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.",

    "title": "Inhomogeneous mixing: From microscopic dynamics to mesoscopic staircases",
    "abstract": "Inhomogeneous mixing and the consequent mesoscopic layered structure have been observed in many physical systems, including magnetically confined fusion plasmas. Especially, in plasmas, mixing can be enhanced through turbulence spreading by intermittent coherent structures (blobs/voids), or suppressed due to the formation of transport barriers (sheared zonal flows). Interestingly, blobs/voids and zonal flows are not independent, and they can co-exist in a state of inhomogeneous mixing, often called the E x B staircase. In this paper, we first introduce recent experimental progress on the physics of blobs/voids: how turbulence spreading by blobs/voids occurs, the consequences of enhanced turbulence spreading for the power decay length, and the interaction between blobs/voids and zonal flows. Then, we provide a brief review of experimental results on staircases, or more generally layered mesoscopic transport barriers. Staircases are often elusive and different complementary methods have been utilized to identify them, but our understanding is still incomplete. This paper serves as an initial step toward applying insights gained from inhomogeneous mixing due to blobs/voids to the understanding of a staircase.",

    "abstract": "We present calculations of diffusion coefficients in grain boundaries in Yukawa crystals for astrophysics. Our methods follow from our recent work calculating diffusion coefficients in perfect body-centered cubic crystals. These diffusion coefficients show only a weak dependence on the crystal orientations at the grain boundary and are consistent with those expected for a supercooled liquid scaled down by one to two orders of magnitude. We argue that the local disorder at the grain boundary produces a landscape of potential barriers similar to that of an amorphous liquid thin film, significantly reducing activation barriers to diffusive hops relative to the bulk solid. This also introduces a screening dependence, such that boundary diffusion does not exhibit the same universality as the bulk crystal. These diffusion coefficients suggest that grain boundaries may be a dominant source of viscous dissipation in neutron star crusts.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence is fundamental to energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical plasmas. Bow shock interactions have long been hypothesized to significantly modify turbulence in planetary environments, yet the quantification of such effects and their parametric dependencies remain largely unaddressed. Using in situ long-term high-time resolution measurements from NASA's MAVEN mission, we report the first observational characterization of the evolution and parametric dependence of the turbulence energy cascade rate $\\varepsilon_C$ at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales. Key findings reveal an averaged three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in $\\varepsilon_C$ when transitioning from the solar wind to the magnetosheath. Notably, downstream measurements of oblique and quasi-perpendicular shocks exhibit higher energy dissipation rates than those of quasi-parallel configurations. These results provide the first direct evidence linking shock obliquity to turbulence amplification, offering key insights into shock-mediated turbulence in similar but inaccessible systems.",

We employ atomic data from R-Matrix calculations to investigate radiative properties in high-energy-density (HED) plasma sources. Specifically, we analyze environments such as the base of the convective zone (BCZ) of the Sun 2 x 10^6$ K, N_e = 10^{23}/cc and the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device at the Sandia Z facility 2.11 x 10^6 K, N_e = 3.16 x 10^{22}/cc. We calculate Rosseland Mean Opacities (RMO) within a range of temperatures and densities and analyze how they vary under different plasma conditions. In this study, we specifically focus on electron collisional and Stark ion microfield broadening effects on autoionizing resonances in photoabsorption cross sections. Our results are relevant to astrophysical models, particularly in the context of the solar opacity problem, and provide insights into discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. In addition, we investigate the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities. In addition, we examine the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities of the \"chemical picture\" Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen EOS with respect to level populations of excited levels included in the R-matrix calculations. This study should contribute to improving opacity models of HED sources such as stellar interiors adn laboratory fusion plasma experiments.",
