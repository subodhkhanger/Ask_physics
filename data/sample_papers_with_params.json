    "abstract": "We report on recent experiments conducted at the DIII-D tokamak facility achieving improved confinement in H-mode plasmas. Peak electron temperatures of 5.2 keV were achieved in the plasma core with line-averaged electron density of 6.7×10¹⁹ m⁻³. The central ion temperature reached approximately 4.8 keV. These results demonstrate significant progress toward fusion-relevant conditions with ne = 7.2 × 10^19 m^-3 and Te = 5.2 keV sustained for 3.5 seconds.",
